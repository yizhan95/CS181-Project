Only two minor complaints are no telephones in room for room service (not a huge deal for us) and no AC in the room, but they have huge windows which can be fully opened. The staff were incredible though, letting us borrow umbrellas for the rain, giving us maps and directions, and also when we had lost our only UK adapter for charging our phones gave us a very fancy one for free.\\n\\nI would highly recommend this hotel to friends, and when I return to Edinburgh (which I most definitely will) I will be staying here without any hesitation.')\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We went in with high hopes after a friend recommended Delmonico but we left just a bit disappointed.  The ambiance was really nice and we were given a great table without a reservation but the food left a little to be desired.  \n",
      "\n",
      "My friend and I both started with lobster bisque, which was good but a little thin.  We noticed right away too that she had 2 tiny little pieces of lobster in hers, but I had almost an entire small claw.  I was happy until I realized it was tough and rubbery.  I actually had to use a knife and fork to cut it into bite sized pieces.  My husband ordered the wedge salad as a starter and it was 80% white/yellow core.  Not what you would expect in a place as pricey as this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the fillet and it was cooked perfectly but it was not a great cut of meat.  Maybe I have high standards, but I think a $30+ fillet should be butter knife soft, but this one was kind of fibrous and hard to cut with a steak knife.  I didn't really care for the seasoning either, but that's a personal preference, not something I can count against the restaurant.  My husband's rib eye was really fatty but he loved his twice baked potato.  I had the corn gratin for my side and it was tasty but again, not my style.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Our server was efficient but pretty standoffish.  When we first sat down, we ordered a bottle of \"Emerel's Blend\" wine and he nicely suggested that we might want to try something else, but other than that, his interaction with us was a bit cold.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe it was an off night, but I really expected more from a $400+ dinner.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I want to give this place 2 stars, but because of the excellent service I'll bump it up to 3. The best thing about this place was the impeccable service received.  I dined here with my husband on a late Friday night.  The food here was just \"OK\". My breakdown of each dish is this:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Popovers: meh..they were ok. I think they were over cooked which made them a bit too dry and with a slightly burnt butter taste. I like Tyler Florence does a better version at Wayfare Tavern (SF).\n",
      "\n",
      "Appetizer special - Pappardelle w/ Crimini Mushrooms in a white wine sauce finished with parmigiana: Good stuff. Very light and tasty pasta, too many mushrooms for my liking, I would've preferred more pasta. Very small tasting plate so don't expect to get more than 3 or 4 bites.\n",
      "\n",
      "Creamed spinach: Another meh dish. I wanted more flavor here. Maybe a finish with butter would've helped. Some seasoning or something. Literally all I could taste was watery spinach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twice Baled loaded Potatoes: YESSSSSS PLEASE! Now this was a great dish. Flavor in every bite. Perfect partner for my steak.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ribeye Steak (w/o bone) OSCAR STYLE w/ Jumbo Lump Crab Meat, Grilled Asparagus and Béarnaise.- I SOOOOOO wanted to love this steak. I really did. Order a my steak cooked medium and unfortunately it came out damn near rare. Like literally just short of bleeding. There was hardly any flavor.  The best part was the burnt edges as they actually added some flavor. I'd give my steak a 2/5, however, the Jumbo Lump crab and Béarnaise WAS THE BOMB!\n",
      "\n",
      "Smoked Pork chop: my husband truly enjoyed his pork chop. Tender with a smokey flavor all the way thru. The pork chop was huge! I'm not a big pork chop eater, but it was tasty. \n",
      "\n",
      "Pecan pie: Now this was worth the price of admission. A tasty warm & nutty pie with cold delicious ice cream. Mmmmm mmmmm good. I'd come here again just to eat this. A MUST have if you're ordering desserts.\n",
      "\n",
      "As previously mentioned in other reviews, the wine here is definitely over priced. I understand the mark ups restaurants need to make, but I think Delmonico's takes the \"upcharge\" to an entirely new level. We ordered a bottle of Kim Crawford's Sauvignon Blanc, which retails for about $18-20, we were charged $45 for the bottle!!! Talk about a rip off! Outside of opening the bottle and pouring the wine, what constitutes a $25 mark up?\n",
      "\n",
      "Needless to say I most likely won't return here. I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think it was worth the price tag. I'd prefer to go back to Mario Batali's B&B, which is located directly across the walk way from Delmonico's.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Went here for guys weekend. Unbelievable. Ravioli app was so good. The steak was very good too. When getting a good bottle of wine, make sure they decant it for you...had to ask.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] One word my friends: tableside!!! Yes, tableside carving of your steak chateaubriand for two/Creekstone farm steaks never disappoints. One of the best dinners I had this year for sure.  I would recommend Delmonico restaurant in Vegas who ever goes to Vegas or lives there.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Delmonico is settled within the Venetian hotel and with a 5 pm dinner reservation , they were pretty busy by 6 pm. I'm assuming people want to eat good streak before different shows and other entertainment in Vegas. Service was impeccable with the server and assistant both working harmoniously together.  The restaurant is not overly pretentious or glamorous looking.  I liked the overall atmosphere with the white walls/crisp white tablecloths on the tables with dim lighting.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The service starts with the complimentary brioche bread and butter which were decadently heavenly.  Then they entice and educate you about their wine list etc but I don't drink so I was ready to order some steak, steak, steak! I did the chateaubriand steak for two carved for us.  It was a 18oz steak but really my 9 oz share was big but so yummy so yes I was able to finish my portion.  The garlic smashed potatoes were delicious.  The creamed spinach was just ok, a bit of a let down.  \n",
      "Other than that I enjoyed every minute of my dinner before my red eye flight back to Florida.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We tried their French escargot w/ garlic herb butter on toasted baguette. This was our first time trying french-style escargot and we didn't like it. It's not as if it was badly prepared. It's an acquired taste and we were just not big fans of it. Our waiter did notice we didn't finish the dish so he asked if everything was ok. We politely nodded. Surprisingly, they took this item off our bill which was really nice. Service was awesome throughout. My fiancé had the bone-in-rib eye. I had their special - lobster pasta. Both were very good. Overall, I thought the food was decent. The experience was excellent.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I've never had a meal experience like what I had at Delmonico's. Me and a buddy were in Vegas for the first time and decided we wanted to go out for a good steak dinner. I asked for recommendations from people and settled on Delmonico's. I made reservations the Monday before the Thursday we went to dinner. I checked out the menu ahead of time and was not surprised to see the pretty high prices., I was confident though that we were gonna get what we paid for. \n",
      "We arrived about 45 minutes before the reservation time and had a couple beers in the lounge. $6 for a Bud Light was pretty reasonable for this atmosphere. We were seated promptly at 7 and that's where things got impressive. The dining area is secluded, you have no idea you are in a casino, which is great. We were greeted by one of our 3 waiters and offered the wine menu. Neither of us drink wine, but I could tell the selection was awesome. \n",
      "We ordered the truffle and Parmesan potato chips and bowls of the gumbo. Both were excellent, Emeril knows gumbo. I ordered the bone-in ribeye and my buddy got the filet. We also got the potato gratin and a twice baked potato. The sides are ala carte and family style. They were some of the best potatoes we had ever had. As for the steaks, they were both the greatest steaks we had ever had! No sauce is necessary for these babies. After dinner I had the banana cream pie, which was exceptional. My buddy had the cheesecake and said it was awesome. \n",
      "Overall I can not speak highly enough of the dining experie nce at Delmonico's. The professional staff, excellent atmosphere, and amazing food make Delmonico's a place I will go to again.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Truffle and Parm Chips are a must have.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little dinner rolls they pass out are awesome!\n",
      "\n",
      "Lobster bisque was good, seafood chowder was good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bone-in Rib-eye was tasty. Cooked well, flavored well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pork chop was pretty whatevers though. Probably can skip out on that one.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Located inside my favorite hotel Venetian, Delmonico is one of Emeril's restaurant. When you walk in, the decor is very minimal but sophisticated with arched ceilings that makes you feel like you're inside a European gallery. \n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered the following:\n",
      "-Deviled eggs: delicious! Very creamy, topped with King Crab meat is a plus.\n",
      "-truffle potato chips: good sharable appetizer. \n",
      "-New Orleans style barbecue shrimp: if you're into Cajun style barbecue shrimp, definitely order this dish. A bit different from the ones we had in New Orleans but still good. \n",
      "-Lobster bisque: has good amount of chunky Lobster meat, but not the best I've had. \n",
      "-ribeye: due to pregnancy, I had to order a well done steak. My steak came close to medium well, pink in the inside. I sent the steak back, it came back still not completely well done. Sent it back for the second time and the steak came back as beef jerky.. I expected at least the second time around for them to make a new one as I know the effect of cooking a piece of steak multiple times. Of course I wasn't expecting a well done steak to be juicy and tender but I have had a properly cooked well done steak before that's was not super tough! Flavor on the steak was pretty good, but could not taste the dry aged flavor as much. In the end, the restaurant took this off the bill, which was a nice gesture. \n",
      "-sides: Creamy corn (very good), mushrooms (a bit salty but good flavor), twice baked potatoes (good). \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I would give this restaurant 3 and a half stars.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] As far as steakhouses goes in Las Vegas, you can almost never go wrong if you're willing to pay $50-75 for a steak for the most part, or at least maybe I've been lucky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Delmonico's is a solid restaurant, which for me is highlighted by Emeril's Banana Cream Pie which features Caramel Sauce, Chocolate Shavings and Whipped Cream.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've gone to the lounge seating area just to indulge in a slice of their Banana Cream Pie, so if you love pie, and BCP, then you've got to find the time and make room for this...\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] After the most incredible service, delicious meal, and surprise birthday treat how can you rate this fabulous restaurant anything less than five stars?\n",
      "\n",
      "We opted to celebrate my partners birthday celebration at Del's and it was definitely the best decision EVER. Although Las Vegas traffic sucked and it took 40 min to get there from Cosmopolitan. \n",
      "\n",
      "We had the best crew serving us tonight, be sure to ask for Braden, Selina, and JoJo. Amazing folks and with a great sense of humor and honest recommendations. \n",
      "\n",
      "GET the chateaubriand and if you like spices, add the au poivre. Worth every penny and then some. Skip an appetizer unless you have multiple people in your party, the steak will fill you up and then some! We didn't have room for dessert but was treated to an ice cream waffle cone with a delicious flavor to celebrate the man's birthday. \n",
      "\n",
      "Oh yeah, don't be shocked by the 100 page wine list or the bottles ranging up to $37,000. You can find some reasonably priced options! We will be back!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Pork Chops looked amazing although, I don't like pork chops... The guest who had them said one of the best they've EVER had... I ordered salad and the jumbalya- it was good, not fantastic...\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Exceptional...exceptional steakhouse!! Ordered ribeye bone out and I've never had such an amazing cut of meat in my life! I died and went to heaven! The service is phenomenal! Had a huge party of about 15 and everyone was well attended too! The sides are superb too! Such a great atmosphere! Sophisticated an chic! Loved loved this place! A MUST when visiting Vegas!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Went there for the thanksgiving dinner. What a mistake! Dry turkey with horrible tasting green beans. Also ordered mojitos and they were the worse I've had. I do not know about the rest of the menu but the thanksgiving dinner was overpriced and gross. The two stars are for the dinner roles and the parmesan chips.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Service was fantastic. Food was good, but it really didn't hold a candle to the other food I had in Vegas this weekend. I had the chicken breast entree and the potatoes it came with were exquisite, but the chicken breast was really not as moist as it could have been, and I was a bit disappointed. Was expecting more from Emerile.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I am going to preface this review by saying that we were given free desserts and a special appetizer from the chef. This was due to my sister knowing the general manager as she was a Vegas concierge for many years. That being said, I thought the meal experience was outstanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were celebrating an anniversary and there were seven of us including a 7 year old. The waiter brought the aforementioned free appetizer, a steak and blue cheese  croquette and foie grae with cherry compote. Not bad. I started with the baby greens with fried mozzarella. The lettuce was decent, the mozzarella cold and disappointing. \n",
      "\n",
      "I asked a waiter, not ours, what she recommends and she said easily the Rib Eye in Bone. It saved the meal. As juicy as any steak I've ever had, and spiced to perfection with a dollop of butter melting on top. My wife enjoyed the 2 pound lobster and had started with the Lobster Bisque which she also devoured. The sides were OK. I had the Twice Baked potato with bacon and cheese, but also sampled the french fries, which they specially made for the 7 year old, and they were quite good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dessert, since it was free, was a virtual sampler platter. The pecan pie was excellent. The bread pudding was disapponting - I've never tried it with cubed up bread with sauce on top and not enough to reach the bottom and served with Oreo ice cream and chocolate Magic Shell. I sampled three flavors of ice cream and gelato and disliked them all, they tasted like ice milk.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was impeccable. Never a want. And the price was not bad, $325 for 7 people but if I included the freebies then it would have touched $400. Bottom line is I'd go back if staying at the Venetian but would try others if not.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We were very disappointed with our meal. The waiter had absolutely no knowledge of the wine selection and therefore could not provide any recommendations. The steaks were flavorless and not cocked as requested. The side of broccoli was lukewarm and wine glasses were dirty. The best part of the meal was the caramel butter cake dessert and Fisticuffs cabernet.  We go to steakhouses quite often and Delmonico's ranks towards the very bottom of our list.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We started off with the pork trotter, butternut squash ravioli & bbq shrimp. I loved the ravioli and the shrimp was also really good. That trotter was just so-so. Not worth ordering again in the future. I had to of course order the bone-in ribeye for my entree. It's disappointing to me when a steakhouse doesn't cook a steak the way you had requested... especially a high end one such as this. I ordered medium-rare. It was definitely cooked medium. I don't usually send food back because other people are with me and I'd have to make them wait. I can still enjoy my food if it's not perfect. However, I do make a note of it on my reviews so that the chefs and future customers know. I'm sure this isn't a mistake that they make regularly (At least I hope not!). I also prefer a saltier steak. It could have used more fat too. I like my hypertension and cholesterol... The sides we ordered for the table were all delicious. Mushrooms & creamed corn were probably the best. Creamed spinach and gratin were just okay. I tried some of my friend's chicken. It was pretty good, but the sides it came with were the most impressive. \n",
      "\n",
      "As expected from a nice steakhouse such as this, the service was excellent.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Fabulous! This place will not disappoint. I had the special which was wild caught salmon. I have never tasted salmon so delicious.My husband had the steak and he said it was the best $50 he ever spent on food. We hope to visit again next year.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] They are known for their bone-in ribeye so I had to try that.  I ordered mine medium rare and it was a little undercooked but still very tasty.  The steak was good but not the best I've had.  What was really amazing was the white fish.  This was the first time I tried the white fish and I will order this again.  I also tried the New Orleans bbq shrimp which was good and the au gratin potatoes.  The sides are huge and we had a hard time finishing one side.  Service was excellent and the restaurant had a nice modern contemporary look which I liked.  Overall, a good steakhouse and I had a good experience here.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Second time I've eaten here.\n",
      "Made reservations for 6 people and we showed with only three and they said no problem.After they sat us 2 of our missing 3 showed up and the staff immediately got a second table pulled over and seated the other,I thought was awesome.\n",
      "We all placed our orders and 4 out the five of us got the bone in ribeye,and we all said it was one of the best steaks we have had ever.\n",
      "Sides where all very good also.\n",
      "Grits,smashed potatoes,baked potato was huge.\n",
      "The staff was great and was a very well oiled machine.\n",
      "Dominic was our head waiter and he was great.\n",
      "We will back this summer for another stop!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] After my first bite into a DelMonico's medium-rare filet, the taste indelibly etched itself into my memory. So much so, in fact, that I dreamt about the steak the following day. \n",
      "\n",
      "Is the drool obvious?\n",
      "\n",
      "I could eat this steak every day. I could eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I would bow down to the cow that produced this steak.\n",

      "As you can see, I'm offering a ringing endorsement for this Emeril-owned establishment. It is, hands down, the best steak I've ever had. They cook the meat to perfection, slightly bloody, just the way I like it, and crusted with a seasoning that offers just enough taste to add flavor to the steak, but not to take away from the meaty perfection.\n",

      "Reservations must be made significantly in advance. And don't be surprised when the bill comes-like i said, it's not cheap. But the service is amazing and totally attentive, and the food speaks for itself. It's in the posh Venetian (by far one of my favorite hotels in Sin City), so you want to dress to impress and sip top shelf martinis. Yum. I wish I were there right now. Where's my steak knife, dammit?\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Story to say, this is not where you should spend your money.  The waiter asked my wife how she liked her salmon cooled!  Then it came out with BBQ sauce on it and the salmon was not cooked through.  I ordered gumbo.  The shrimp was frozen and over cooked and mediocre at best.  Not what I would expect from a chef from the south.  Bad experience and would never repeat.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Great food, great service. Expect to pay a pretty penny, but worth it for a splurge in Vegas (esp if you win some $$!). Ladies, wear your fat dress for this meal.. you'll thank me later.\n",

We ordered the calamari and homemade chips (really tasty) as our appetizers. The asparagus was enough for all four of us to eat (and only $9) the baked potato was hella good too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The con: It is very pricey, steaks start off at about $48, but well worth it. Even if you can only eat here once just do it, very tasty.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Steak! My first trip to Vegas was this past summer with a group of friends. We ate here one night and it's the best steak I have every had in my life. I started with the lobster bisque and for dinner had the boneless ribeye medium rare with a bunch of different sides for the table, no room for desert though. Also two of my friends ordered the Caesar Salad which they make table side (for two people).  \n",
      "\n",
      "Lobster bisque... very very tasty and rich. If you don't like rich foods then you should not order this. It also has nice size chunks of lobster in it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Boneless ribeye, medium rare...Amazing. It was cooked to perfection, just the way medium rare should be. It was well cooked and well seasoned, there's no need to dip it in ketchup or steak sauce. It was a pretty decent size cut of meat too, I can't remember the ounces but I left stuffed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Caesar salad...I'm not a fan of rabbit food but watching the person make it table side it looked really good. In a matter of about 5-8 minutes he made two servings of what I was told was the best Caesar salad ever,\n",
      "\n",
      "At this restaurant, the steak doesn't come with anything, you have to order the sides separately, I think we ordered asparagus, wild sauteed wild mushrooms and twice baked potato. All was cooked to perfection. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Service...it was the outstanding. There are three people per table, so you are always attended to and the waiter is well versed in the menu and the drinks. I wasn't too sure what I wanted so I asked him for a recommendation and he asked me a few questions and based on those answers brought a drink out, which was good. I can't remember the name but it was good. I think it had 3 different kinds of liquor in it but it didn't taste like it at all, not overwhelming, good blend, good bartender. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is expensive but well worth the money. The food, the service, the atmosphere and best of all since it is Vegas no need to really dress up, my kind of place. Definitely have to go there again when I go back during Christmas.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] AWEFUL bone-in ribeye. AVERAGE/BLAND/DRY au-gratin potatoes. GOOD lobster bisque.\n",
      "Both mine and my husband's rib-eyes were gristly and fatty (neither had marbling that is found in good cuts of meat). About 25% to 30% of our steaks were gristle and fat, which we left on our plates. We both thought the seasoning was boring, but we know that's a matter of preference. \n",
      "We eat at nice steakhouses (Del Frisco's, Ruth's Chris, Brook's, Morton's, Elway's, Shannahan's) a couple of times a year, so we think we know about quality steak. Our steak and au-gratin potatoes were something a casual dining restaurant like Chili's or Applebee's would serve.\n",

      "Our demogs: mid-40's, professionally employed, live in Colorado.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I ordered the filet mignon, not the best I had. Cooked right but not as tender. The sides were much better. We had the creamed corn and potatoes au gratin, my favorite. We ordered some kind of butter cake for dessert. No one at our table liked it. One of the servers overheard us talking about the cake and the waiter immediately came and took it off the tab. They do have great service and the decor is nice but with so many great restaurants in the city, I don't need to go back.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Marginal at best.  No atmosphere, bare cream walls.  One bathroom, not too clean for a large restaurant.  Maybe it was an off night, but I found it not great at all.  I have read all of the reviews and I dont get it.\n",

      "\n",
      "I've eaten at many steakhouses in the area and I find that each one has their own unique style. Delmonico's interior isn't highly decorated or cluttered, just a simple and clean look. I liked the simplicity. \n",

      "Our waiter and his team were very attentive. Water glasses were constantly filled, plates cleared efficiently, and service moved smoothly. They were all very professional. \n",
      "\n",
      "The meal begins with popovers that are both soft and flavorful. I began my meal with the Wilted Spinach and Frisee salad. It was anything, but the usual frisee salad because every ingredient was taken to the next level. The bacon vinaigrette had a nice smoky bacon flavor which was tossed in just the right amount with the spinach. The candied bacon was amazing. They perfectly balanced the sweet and salty. The egg on top was cooked to perfection. All of the flavors worked so well together. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was hard to order something other than steak, but it was Thanksgiving so I had to have my traditional dinner. The Thanksgiving dinner didn't disappoint and was a very generous portion. The turkey was very moist and flavorful. The plate had a nice mix of white and dark meat. Under piles of turkey was a moist, delicious cornbread stuffing. A delicious gravy was drizzled over the turkey and stuffing. There was a small side of green beans, but those were not the best thing on the plate as they were a stringy and mushy.\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband and I split a Twice Baked Potato because you have to have potatoes on Thanksgiving. I'm glad we split because it was definitely enough for two. The potato was flavorful and covered in a nice cheese layer.\n",
      "\n",
      "For dessert I had the Pecan Pie and my husband had the Thanksgiving dessert special. My Pecan Pie was served like a tart in a small round, flaky crust. The crust was buttery and flaky. I don't like crust usually, but this was very good. There was plenty of gooey pecan filing and a nice heap of ice cream on top. My husband's special dessert was a trio of pumpkin cheesecake, bread pudding, and ice cream. This kind of fell flat. Nothing had much flavor and was certainly not the best representation of the dessert menu.\n",

      "I can't wait to return and try more of the regular menu items.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The best steak I've ever had!! really great, but also SO LARGE!! I don't think I could even think about red meat for a month after eating it!!\n",
      "\n",
      "I totally recommend that one person gets steak, while the other person gets lobster or something, because it really is too much red meat!! all good though, so it's hard to ding them for giving TOO large of portions, right? I mean its America and we are known for large portions\n",
      "\n",
      "if I lived in Las Vegas, then it would be okay cuz you could just take it home, but com'on most eaters are prolly out of towners...\n",

      "If I wanted top-notch steak in vegas, this is probably were I'd be!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The service was great! When our server came, she apologized saying that she thought someone had already taken our order. We didn't even notice, and it didn't feel like we waited long. It could be due to the multiple servers making sure we got our drinks and bread. \n",
      "\n",
      "We shared the bone-in ribeye (18 ounce) and the butternut squash ravioli and was not disappointed. My partner's only regret is not ordering a ribeye all to himself. Additionally, when we split it, we only had one choice of how we wanted it cooked. I like rare, and my partner likes medium rare. It came out perfect for both of us. \n",
      "\n",
      "The rib-eye was deliciously slightly crispy on the edges with the perfect amount of fat to make it melt-in-your mouth. The flavor was delicious and makes me want more thinking back to it. \n",
      "\n",
      "The butternut squash ravioli was very delicious as well and a wonderful surprise. We did not know what to expect of it. My partner loved it. He loved the sweet flavor inside the ravioli. I am personally not a huge fan of the sweet potato genre, and it did taste a great deal like sweet potato with butternut squash texture within a delicious ravioli. It deserves a 10/10, it's just not my preference.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] It was my last night of being in Vegas for a trade show.  Everyone from my company all ready left and was alone.  My feet were tired from standing up all three days and didn't want to leave the hotel for dinner.  \n",

I wouldn't thought this but really.....\"torn local basil\".. give me a break..  This was what was expected.  Can you really screw up sliced tomatoes, slapped on burrata on top, \"torn local basil\", red onion, virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar?  My friend's 4 year old daughter can make this dish.\n",
      "*Filet Mignon-medium rare: was the toughest filet mignon I EVER HAD!!!  WTF?!?!?  It was cooked correctly, but TOUGH at $50 for 9oz.  The filet I had at Outback was much more tender. \n",
      "*Grits w/bacon and white cheddar: If you like steel cut oats, you'll like this, which I do.  Not creamy like most grits.  Has texture.\n",
      "*Banana cream pie: OMG... I LOVE banana cream pie, but this was really bad.  The cream was sooo thick it was almost like a dense cake.  It looks impressive because of the layers of banana.  The flavor wasn't there. Safeways' banana cream pie is MUCH BETTER!! \n",
      "\n",
      "I also had a cocktail and a glass of red wine.  My meal came up to almost $200.  I don't mind paying the price if the food was worth it... IT WAS NOT!!!  \n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Celebrated hubby's birthday here.  The whole experience was top notch from the service, the food, and the attention to detail.  The moment we walked into the restaurant, the host greeted us by saying \"Happy Birthday\" to my hubby, which started the night great for us.  For once, I didn't get a side eye or a raised eyebrow when I asked my steak to be well-done; there was no snobby attitude from our server, and all the food we ordered was cooked to perfection.  Hubby ordered the bone-in ribeye (medium), I ordered regular ribeye, and we shared twice baked potato.  Their portions were so generous that we had no room for dessert.  Specialty cocktails didn't live up to my expectation and was a bit of a let down, but deceptively strong so worth the money.  Over all, really great first time experience here.  Oh, and a shoutout to our server Dale, who was nice, witty, and took care of us.\n",

We went there for New Years Eve 2011/12 and were very disappointed to find that there were no decorations at all, and nothing had been done to bring out any kind of party atmosphere. The food was OK, but what really let the restaurant down was the service. Our waiter did not know the cocktail list. We had to spell the names of the cocktails we wanted for him to be able to order them for us. Same went for the wine, and once we got the wine, he didn't poor it for us a single time throughout the night, not even to taste when he first opened the bottle.\n",
      "Clearing the table was slow, and no one came to offer dessert, coffee or anything else after we had finished our main course. Getting the bill also took some time, and not a single person acknowledged us when we got up to leave, not a \"thank you\" or even a \"good bye\". We felt like we were being ignored, or forgotten, as we could see the people at the table next to us being looked after a lot better than we were. There was no reason for them to treat us this way. I work in service myself and I always make a point to be nice, pleasant and polite when at a restaurant, and if an honest mistake is made, I am normally very forgiving, but this was too much. We expected much better and I would not recommend this restaurant at all.\n",

      "* Popovers - 5 stars: The BEST, small, light, airy, chewy, you could almost stuff the entire thing in your mouth. I've had good popovers at NM, but like the texture and size of these more. AND they give you a huge plate of softened salted butter - WINNER.\n",
      "* Lobster Bisque - 4.5 stars: One of the better lobster bisque's I've had! Great overall flavor, rich and decadent.\n",
      "* Side of mushrooms, creamed corn, fingerling potatoes - 3.5 stars: All of these were good. 3 kinds of mushrooms cooked generously in butter, my favorite. Followed by the creamed corn, very different with a strong jalapeno flavor. Fingerling potatoes standard.\n",
      "* Banana Cream Pie - 3.5 stars: Emerill's famous banana cream pie is huge - stacked high with chunks of fresh banana. The cream needed more banana flavor, seemed overwhipped, and the crust could've been more buttery. Was still good though.\n",
      "* Key Lime Pie - 3.5 stars: Really good key lime pie on an excellent crust, a little too sweet for me though.\n",
      "* German chocolate cake - 2 stars: Cake tasted airy, reminded me of box cake. Prefer Duncan Hines (sorry!).\n",
      "* Chateaubriand - 2.5 stars: Had an incredibly tender well-seasoned Tomahawk at Beauty and Essex, and in close second was Carnevino's. The Chateaubriand is a hunk of meat for two, sliced and cooked tableside. The meat was tender, but the texture kind of reminded me of a pot roast (not a fan), and it had a bit of a weird, gamey flavor....Recommend sticking with the ribeye.\n",

      "\n",
      "Food:  The steak was cooked perfectly medium-rare, not under, not over, just right.  Nothing fancy for the seasoning, just good old salt and pepper.  A nice seared crust on the outside, nice and tender on the inside.  However, I wouldn't call it the best steak I've ever had, but it was very good.  The wild mushrooms were excellent, I would order those again for sure.  The braised beef ribs were okay, not great.  A bit too salty, but I guess that's why it was on the Specials menu.\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I came here for lunch, and it was great. The bread that showed up before the meal was light and fluffy. We had the fried chicken and a grilled ricotta cheese and basil sandwich with tomato bisque. This was the best fried chicken ever!! It was extra extra crispy. The ricotta sandwich was also very good, but not as good as the chicken.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This place is top notch. We didn't order any appetizers as we wanted to make sure we had enough room to finish our steak. I mean that's the most important part of a steak house right? \n",
      "\n",
      "Although their cuts are bigger enough to split if you wanted to order a few apps and room but for us it was all steak type of night. Let's start with the ambiance it's self: like any other high end steak house very roomy and intimate setting. Lights are dim.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The device was top notch we we greeted immediate as we sat, water came out, and wine list brought to us. It was my wife's bday so we were definitely having a glass. Their drink menu had several options of wine, cocktails, etc.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The croissant that they bring out was fluffy and buttery. The knock is they bring you just one. I could have eaten 20. I'm sure if asked I could have had another. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the bone in New York strip and I have to say it was by far the best strip I've ever had. My wife ordered the ribeye and I did try a bite. While tender and tasted well. It was slightly warmer on temp than she liked. My strip was better. But by no means was her's bad. The twice baked potato tasted awesome and we shared an order. The steak being so large we could barely eat the side. \n",
      "\n",
      "Price point is similar to all other 4 star and up type of steak houses. It is definitely one I'd go back next time in Vegas.\n",

      "Took hubby here for our 1 yr. anniversary/my hubby's b-day.  I wasn't hungry (late lunch) so I had a (delicious) salad and wine, and he got a bourbon, the filet with creamed spinach and au gratin potatoes.  From the second we got there till we left they treated us like royaly.  Ross, the manager, came and chatted with us at our table, offering an appetizer on the house because of our big day.  They even plated my year-old wedding cake top tier, frozen for a year and in a bag for 6 hours on a plane from NY, and presented it to us with candles on a small table with plates and forks.  The filet, by the way, almost brought me to orgasm with a single bite.  Seriously.... no, seriously.  It was prob the best single bite of beef I've ever experienced.\n",
      "What else.... the year-old cake was surprisingly good! (I baked it myself) :)\n",
      "Of course it's a killer bill at meal's end ($135 for everything I mentioned above and nothing more) but worth every penny, y'all.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] In town for business, had several great meals. However tonight I am eating alone and craving a nice piece of prime cut. I chose this restaurant based on rating and expected value. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ordered the bone-in prime ribeye, a signature dish, asparagus and a glass of house red. \n",
      "\n",
      "The service was excellent for the entire meal. The table bread was good but in my opinion was really better suited for breakfast or needed gravy like Yorkshire pudding. The house red (a cab) was excellent, sorry forgot what I ordered, but it was the least expensive but was very good. \n",
      "\n",
      "Was served quickly, if I had clients with me I would hope for a little slower pace but alone the speed was appreciated. \n",
      "\n",
      "The asparagus was perfect, not over cooked or smothered with too much butter, and very tender. The ribeye however came up very short, lacked taste and was tough, not what you would expect from aged prime ribeye. The waiter respond quickly and offered a new steak, I decided on the filet. I was served as fast as possible, the new steak rectified the problem, perfectly charbroiled, taste and texture as expected. Also served fresh asparagus. \n",
      "\n",
      "Dessert, ordered the pecan tart and a cap. Both very good. The pecan very tasteful, the filling was not too runny or too sweet and the pecans were fresh with a deep southern taste. The crust was very favorable and went well with the Carmel and house made ice cream and whipping cream. \n",
      "\n",
      "Other notes, good lighting and I liked the architectural ceiling. Chairs are stylist and very comfortable. I recommend adjusting the traffic flow, two much weaving required and not ideal for guest seated in wrong location. Never like sitting near restroom entrance, which I was; as much as I like most people watching I would of asked to be moved if with clients or my spouse. Lastly white sugar cubes, really?\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] 2nd strike emeril! i was diappointed with emeril's fish house but decided to give his steak house a try. i ordered the steak and scallop dish. my scallops were overcooked!!! unacceptable! my steak and my friend's steak were good but i will probably try other steakhouses before coming back here.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] the best meal ive ever had hands down. cooked perfectly high quality you get what you pay for and wont be disappointed\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Great ambiance.  Heirloom tomato salad appetizer was perfect way to start.  Steak was perfectly cooked and superb flavor.  Desert was delicious.  Not a cheap place, but worth it.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Looking for a good steakhouse while in Vegas we found this place in our hotels restaurant guide. Being a celebrity chefs place I had my doubts but will always try something at least once. Delmonico did not disappoint, they delivered on par excellent service and quality food in a classy but intimate ambiance. We have already arranged to go back in the coming Vegas trip. The steaks, as you would expect, were above expectations in taste, searing, and quality of beef. Most importantly in order to enjoy a good meal you need impeccable service along with it. It was the kind of service that is very professional and classy but in a way that makes you feel welcome and comfortable, not stiff and robotic. Its an experience you have to try for yourself that you won't regret. The NY strip will turn a vegetarian!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] There are many good steakhouses. This is a GREAT one. I had the shrimp cocktail which was excellent - big shrimp not over cooked. The wedge was great with real bacon and plenty of blue cheese crumbles. The bone-in ribeye was the best I have had. Great seasoning. Nice crust. Perfectly cooked. The banana creme pie was huge. Sinful. OMG I am so stuffed.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Service was thorough and precise, not the friendliest but there were no errors. \n",
      "\n",
      "Decor, well, ummmm there is none. Lights on a wire cable is the extent of that. Don't expect more, I'm not joking. Not a painting, wall paper, photo, drawing or stitch of color. Anywhere. Plain, off white walls.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bread was lovely (I always taste the bread) I ate it all, without shame.\n",
      "\n",
      "Specialty cocktails were all great, we tried 3, all of which I forgot the names of but the gin with Midori was my fave, I may have had 2 possibly 3 lol\n",
      "\n",
      "Food was above average but not mind blowing\n",
      "\n",
      "King crab app was okay, didn't taste fresh to me\n",
      "\n",
      "Table side Cesar salad was good, I liked the dressing and loved the anchovies but the presentation was done behind me so I didn't get to enjoy the show. Note to self-when you return don't sit in a booth. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bone in ribeye was yummy. We shared, but it wasn't the medium my husband ordered but I wasnt devastated because I prefer medium rare although it was closer to rare. Mushrooms were good, nothing special.\n",
      "\n",
      "Caramel cake was delish, very sweet but that's the point! \n",
      "\n",
      "We will be back, it will be awhile since date nights are rare due to a 2.5 year old child beast but we will be back. I look forward to the filet.\n",

      "Such yummy goodness\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Maybe it's the media hyped downturned economy or maybe D's was having a bad Friday night but......this isn't the same Delmonico's I've experienced for many years prior (pre-yelp and post-yelp).  \n",
      "\n",
      "12 people again dined as we do every year at Delmonico's around the same time of the year and everyone I think felt it was not entirely the same restaurant.   \n",

      "Service: Great service as always but noticeably reduced in staff size, not as sharp (forgot my Voss that I ordered with my meal - $20 water you better remember it)\n",
      "\n",
      "Ambiance: Not a lot of people in the restaurant for a prime hour on a Friday night.  Everyone seemed a little sullen. \n",

      "Food: \n",
      "Truffled Chips:  They were good, truffle oil evident and tastey\n",
      "Amuse Bouche:  Flank Steak + peanut oil, a little overcooked, free\n",
      "Wedge:  Watery blue cheese dressing, salty... had better\n",
      "Lobster Bisque Soup:  Fishy, thick, sub-par \n",
      "Bone In Ribeye:  Didn't taste anything like the previous years, possible downgraded steaks?  No earthy taste to the palate, thinner chop than normal.  Foie Gras served over steak made the steak better and could of eaten the FG by itself.  \n",
      "Filet:  good, again tasted downgraded, maybe Choice +\n",
      "Oscar side:  good and very tastey\n",
      "Lobster:  not recommended by waiter but it was good, actually the better of the entrees....strange right?\n",
      "Desserts (we eat a lot of this)  Birthday cake.... the fudge frosting was good but the cake sucked\n",
      "Blueberry Cobbler:  awesome!!  this is always good\n",
      "Banana Cream Pie:  ehh....only half eaten\n",
      "Key Lime Tart:  overly sugary and made my teeth hurt, it had a strange sugar taste...didn't remind me of key lime anything... sent back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last 4-5 years I gave 5 stars and would of given 6 if possible... this year was a 3, nothing memorable but an expensive bill.  I hope this economy turns around or what ever it is and I can enjoy my Delmonicos next year at what I've known it to be.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Quite delicious! I wouldn't say that this Steakhouse is creative or unique, but what I will say is that it's classic, delicious and savory. The decor is comfortable, quietly & minimally luxurious and the service was very good without being intruding. I was dining with my family (sister, mom, father and my husband Russ). \n",
      "\n",
      "For an appetizer, I ordered the Lobster Bisque which was very good but not super memorable and for the entree, I ordered the Surf and Turf. Perfection. I found everything to be just as I ordered it and savored every last piece of my meal. We got the Bacon-Cheddar Polenta which was remarkably good and the mashed potatoes (which I didn't try) and also, the creamed spinach. It may not be revolutionary, but Delmonico's does good food just right :D\n",
      "\n",
      "I wouldn't say that I really \"stepped out of my box\" with what I ordered, but I will say that they have a wonderful wine list, a nice group of people working for them, and tasty food. This is the perfect place to dine with a small group or family where everyone can get something they like. It's more of a safe bet while dining in Vegas - but a good one. It's also located in the Venetian - which is as they say - a \"feast for the eyes\" I like!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The staff, servers (Michael and Co.) went beyond our expectations for service.  We were celebrating our anniversary, and they provided both an appetizer and dessert for free.The atmosphere is casual elegant, not stuffy, but very beautiful in a simple way.  You must try the Caesar salad, made for two at the table, AMAZING!!  We both had a steak, my NY Strip not quite as flavorful as partner's Rib Eye, which was one of the best steaks I have ever eaten.  The entire meal experience was unforgettable, and the pricetag, although steep, was worth it. We will return.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I had the bone-in rib-eye, which is the best steak I've had in my life. Deliciously juicy, tender, full of beef flavor, with just the right amount of bite, the thought of this steak is making me salivate while writing this review.\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend had his with the foie gras. If you like foie gras at all, DO THIS. It might seem a bit odd to pair these two together, but when I tried it, it set off little fireworks off my taste buds.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I guess the 4th time is the charm!!  My brother was nice enough to get us a gift certificate here so even though we didn't really want to come back here again we decided to order things we wouldn't normally get at a steakhouse.  Stuff like chateaubriand which was fn awesome and way better than anything else I had there the last 3 times.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This was a dinner for work.. not sure if I'd pay for it on my own dime, but it was excellent! Service was excellent. The sommelier even happily took back a $120 bottle of wine (guess that's cheap by Vegas standards!) when the 2nd bottle smelled corked. \n",
      "\n",
      "Appetizers:\n",
      "*butternut squash ravioli - recommended if you love duck! Covered in duck confit.. yummy!\n",
      "*BBQ shrimp - sauce was rich, heavy and delish. It was almost a combination of a gumbo base and bbq sauce\n",
      "*foie gras with berry tart (on the daily specials menu) - wow! if you follow my reviews, you know I'm a foie gras lover, but this one was really excellent. The crossed grill marks on it were beautiful\n",
      "\n",
      "Main course:\n",
      "*Bone in ribeye - 18 oz of buttery tasty goodness. Well seasoned. Not best steak I've had in my life material, but quite good.\n",
      "*Ahi tuna - huge portion! Cooked to perfection, but the enormous slabs were kind of off putting. I guess when you're paying $42 for freaking tuna you should get something substantial. Plus it makes you feel more like your steak eating companions to have this retarded big portion on your plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sides:\n",
      "*just get the truffle chips.. you will thank me later!\n",
      "*grits covered in bacon couldn't get more fatty :) No complaints here\n",

      "Dessert:\n",
      "*chocolate bread pudding - very chocolatey!\n",
      "*butterscotch pudding - good but honestly the freebie portion at Bradley Ogden is yummier!!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] One of the best steakhouses I have been to.  The petite filet medallions were perfectly cooked with a parmesan crust.  Never was a big fan of this, but it was really well done.  Tender, well seasoned, and cooked exactly right... a perfect combination.  Besides the steak being in the top 3 or 4 all time favorites (Marriott HI Kona and Waikiki tied for #1, chefs are brothers) the sides of scalloped potatoes and mushrooms are fantastic.   The service was exemplary.  Vegas is back!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] i have to admit, i had a bad experience at this steakhouse from the service being so-so to the food being o.k. the biggest disappointment is that my girlfriends steak and my steak were both cooked incorrectly. i ordered my steak medium rare, my gal medium well. at first i thought the waiter got us mixed up regarding how we wanted our steaks cooked because mines was well done and my girl friends was on the rare side. so when our waiter came back and asked us how everything was, i asked him, \"how did i order my steak?\" he replied, medium rare. i got my steak knife and cut right down the middle of my steak and showed it to the waiter and he glanced at it and replied, looks like it was over cooked slightly. my girlfriend and i both noticed that our waiter was not exactly polite after we pointed out our steaks were cooked incorrectly and didn't offer to bring us new steaks knowingly that the cook blew it by a long shot with the beef. my steak was honestly cooked all the way through. no red and not even any pink. not the end of the world. though this was our saturday night dinner in vegas and we have heard sooo many good things about this restaurant. so we were quite disappointed when we had a somewhat rude waiter and food which was cooked incorrectly. we are going to try this place one more time and give them another shot. i think we just got unlucky. irregardless i have to give the rating in which they provided. sorry delmonico, maybe next time.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Worth every penny, just for the mashed potatoes alone.  That said, the steak is, of course, fantastic.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The strip steak was to die for! The banana desert was absolutely genius. Our server (forgot her name) was fantastic! My hubby's rib eye was good! We will be going back!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Just got back from Vegas and our second visit to Delmonico. We had the Filet Medallions($48) and they were Heavenly ! They had a carmelized onion,Mushroom mixture with a Parmesan crust that absolutely sent them into Orbit !!!!! Not to mention the Prime Dry Aged Filet that was literally \"Cake\" tender and had a deep beef flavor. We also had the Jumbo Australian Lobster tail that was sweet and cooked to perfection in a white wine reduction with aromatic veggies/herbs($95).May I also suggest the Bone In Ribeye($55) which is the house specialty....it's to die for !!!!  In regards to attire it seems like a dressy place but folks were showing up with Tommy Bahama Shirts,Shorts and flip flops and were seated without question and some were \"dudded up\". My wife and I ate for about $200 but it was worth every penny !This a must stop for a special dinner if your a steak lover !!!!   Oh....our table as well as everyone else's had four servers and a host !!!! Exemplary Service\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] If it was not for the price I probably would consider giving it three stars... 1) wine here is overpriced ALOT 2) we ordered bone-in rib eye as median but got almost well-done 3) lamb was tasteless 4) service was mediocre. Overall I had a really hard time giving more than 2 stars for a restaurant that's supposed to be such high-end but has no idea how to cook steak median...\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I've been here 2 times now and both times I haven't been disappointed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ordered my usual Filet Mignon. Definitely a lot of food. They definitely know how to cook their steak, a medium rare is true medium rare. For the sides we shared creamed spinach, shrimp, asparagus, and potatoes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since Vegas gets busy, you definitely need reservations.  If you have a big group, prepare to dine for awhile since food takes some time but totally worth the wait. \n",

      "My go to steak place in Vegas\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] There's a reason this place has been here for 10 years & is still going strong amidst the Vegas mahem of new hot restaurants with celebrity chefs. \n",

      "This was my 2nd visit to Delmonico's & it's still my favorite steak restaurant of all time. I hope when I die I have a meal from here in my belly :)\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My friend and I ordered a bone in ribeye. More than half of it was fat. Not acceptable! The only two things that were really good was the twice baked potato and the banana cream pie. \n",
      "\n",
      "The food is very expensive and not worth it. The ambiance is also lacking for the prices they charge. I will not be coming back to this establishment. You're better off going to Ruth's Chris for the same money spent.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I really enjoyed my experience in here. Its an expensive place so save it for a special night out, unless you're wealthy, than feel free to splurge all you want. \n",

      "From the outside, the restaurant seems small, but once you walk in you'll see its a lot bigger and most of their clients are seated there instead. Spacious seating and dim lighting, everyone is dressed up.\n",
      "\n",
      "My party tried out:\n",
      "\n",
      "Appetizer: Emeril's shrimp, it wasn't bad. I was delicious, but not necessarily memorable or jaw dropping. Our waiter recommended it to us and it wasn't a bad choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soup: Lobster bisque, delicious!!! This is the best lobster bisque I've had in recent memory. A lot of the bisques I've had always added too much wine into so the wine flavor killed the lobster's, but this one was well balanced! Kudos!\n",
      "\n",
      "Entrees: BBQ Salmon, genuinely surprised at how delicious this was. Moist, flavorful, but not overbearing. Potato hash and onion strips went well with it. I ordered a side of mashed potatoes too, which was great. The waiter warned me that I had a lot of potatoes, but I don't mind. Plus, I shared my mash with my party. Other members in my party had the filet mignon and ribeye. I'm not a particular fan of ribeye because of its texture, but they managed to make me like it. \n",
      "\n",
      "We didn't order any dessert, but we did have a few cups of Blue Mountain to end the evening. Soothing, relaxing, and it was a perfect ending to a nice meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was great, our waiter was very efficient, honest, and attentive. No snobby elitist attitude, which is always appreciated. The price is expensive, but what do you expect? Its Vegas! You're going to be spending a lot if you want to have a good time here.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Fantastic bone-in ribeye. Perfectly marbled. Delicious cajun rub. Great wine selection. The gumbo was great, but a little too refined...almost like a stew. Ambiance was a bit sterile. But, you're here for the steak... And it's awesome.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] To start with our luncheon last week, the front hostess was way rude and young.\n",
      "Then was our waiter who seemed to be rude and showing no sings of enjoying his\n",
      "job at this restaurant. Both my husband and I were talking about how people that work in this kind of environment in Vegas have become more and more rude and complacent with customers in the past years. Will not go back. Food was OK!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Decided to have Christmas dinner here with my mom. I had taken a look at the menu and everything seemed to sound great. I am not really into protein and my mom isn't really into meat but we visited the restaurant regardless, because the host was very nice over the phone, it was in our hotel and it was open late! We arrived and we're promptly seated (we had originally made a reservation at 10pm but got there at 9) I was appreciative that they were able to accommodate us!\n",

      "#Creamed Spinach ~ good.  Also not too heavy.  But, not mind blowing.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#Wild Mushroom Pappardelle Pasta with Truffle ~ a decadent appetizer and quite delicious.  ($20)  This was a dinner special, so I don't know if they regularly have it.  Tasty, but quite a small proportion.\n",

That means a lot because I never thought anything could outdo my taste buds over Hugo's Cellar (which I still love very much). The service was excellent. We had reservations and were seated promptly.\n",
      "I enjoyed the Asparagus with Prosciutto wrapped around it they brought to the table. We must have had 3 different people checking on us. As I stated I had the Filet and Garlic Smashed Potatoes. The Filet melted in my mouth it was just so darn tender and flavorful.\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Awesome steak and great service. Sometimes in Vegas you get the snobby attitude and mediocre food. Here I got an unreal steak and great service. It is pricey, but it's Vegas! Everything is pricey!!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This is my favorite steakhouse. I've been here several times in the past year and this has become my go to spot when in Vegas. I've only had their filet mignon and chateaubriand. The flavor is excellent and their sides are also amazing. My favorite are the potato gratin and asparagus. I've taken several people here and they all were impressed with the ambiance and food. Lamont has been my server a few times and has always taken care of us.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My husband brought me here for my birthday. I have nothing but good to say about all the staff here. The food was fantastic! I ordered the bone in rib eye.. well done and it was perfect, They where courteous and got our order right! Loved it we will be coming back again.\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My husband and I were excited to go check out one of Emeril's restaurants but we were very disappointed with the experience!  The ambience is a little sterile and it seems like they forgot to put the art up on the walls.  I ordered the French Onion Soup expecting the brothy soup I've always know, but it was so thick it was almost inedible.  For my entree, I decided to try the Piedmontese Petit Filet Mignon because of the rave reviews.  When I finally took a bite, it tasted like a steak I could have gotten at Black Angus not one that I just paid $50 for.  It was a pretty thin cut of meat and was a little mealy.  My husband ordered the regular Filet Mignon, which was terribly over seasoned.  Our service was nothing special, but we weren't even told about some of the specials that we saw as we were walking out the door.  All in all, there are so many other wonderful places to eat in Las Vegas, I would have loved to spend the $200 I spent on this meal elsewhere!  Definitely a forgettable and regretful experience.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Review is for lunch. Mediocre at best. Food was bland, and anything but memorable. Ambiance non-existent (dated decor, bare walls, quite unappealing). The only value was good service, but that's far from sufficient to recommend this place. With so many choices on the Strip, this would be at the very bottom of my list.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I took my wife and daughter here during spring break. Whow. We each ordered a different kind of steak. Each came out exactly as ordered and at exactly the same time! The steaks were a lot bigger than expected and we had to ask for doggie boxes. (We finished it off the next day!) Great wine selection. Great service.\n",
      "\n",
      "My only complaint is the table are too close together and if the people next to you do not bump you, the waiter does as he passes between tables. That was a real pain. They need to rearrange the seating. Ask for a corner table to avoid this problem. If they fix that, I would give them five stars.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Great service, great food, great environment.  Everything we ordered tasted amazing and the portions were very generous.  Will definitely be back here next time we're in town.  \n",
      "\n",
      "A special thank you to the staff who really made it a great experience.  They were warm and friendly and the made the experience there that much better. Well done!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] interesting cave like setting.  busy, but way overpriced for what it is.  nothing special or memorable about the steaks or sides. average quality food. average service, nothing special to stand out from any other restaurant. hyped name.  professional host greeting.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I went in with high expectations.  \n",
      "The service was what I had expected, they were very attentive and were on top of our needs throughout our meal.  Our waiters were great!  We sat down, water was brought over very quickly, as did the little \"wonton\" topped with kalamata olives and proscuitto thing.  I wasn't very impressed by it, I guzzled my water.  By the time I looked up again, my water had been refilled.  WOW!  The waiter brought our bread and explained the menu.  Then she let us be to ponder upon her words.  I chose the scallops with creamed corn sauce.  They scallops were cooked perfectly and the corn chower had lobster in it!  It was 7 minutes in HEAVEN!  The mister and I both opted for steak.  He has the filet mignon and I had the bone-in NY strip.  We decided to share a twice baked potato with cheese and bacon.  His filet was just a filet.  My NY was HUGE!  If I had known it was going to be so large, I would have gotten a filet too.  I was only able to eat half of mine and was not able to have any potato.  The mister finished his steak and all the potato plus his bread which I didn't touch.  The steaks were cooked med-rare perfectly and seasoned.  I could have done without any seasoning on it but hey, that's how they came.  It wasn't ovewhemling in spices but enough that I didn't need any sauces besides the delicious butter just melting so erotically on the plate.  I was stuffed full of steak but I needed to satiate my sweet tooth.  We shared a pecan pie which came with a mound of ice cream.  The crust was absolutely fantastic and the pecans were not burnt.  We had no wine because we were just too dehydrated from the heat, water was all we needed.  I think the mister was slightly disappointed that his filet mignon wasn't as tender as the kobe steaks he is used to.  OH WELL!  I enjoyed my steak and I enjoyed being tended to like a princess.  I had a great night, it would have been better if the darn tables weren't' so close together.  I would have given it 5 stars, I just didn't like being able to hear what the people next to me were whispering about.  The prices were fairly reasonable for Vegas, we've spent double at Yamashiro's and Redondo Beach pier, plenty of times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't let the dress code fool you too much.  There were so many people in there wearing jeans and shorts, I felt a bit over dressed in a cocktail dress and he was wearing a dress shirt and slacks.  The restaurant looked semi-formal, the people there were looking mighty touristy so the ambiance was slightly off.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Delmonico is a terrific steakhouse, with great food and ambiance. We are from NY and have been to a lot of top notch steakhouses, so were really impressed by this restaurant.  Tom Baker made it even more memorable, great maitre d/waiter! I highly recommended Emeril's BBQ salmon and the bone-in fillet.  The real surprise were the truffle and parmesan potato chips - delicious!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The chicken andouille gumbo is perhaps the best I have ever had and the salt and pepper crust on the filets never disappoints.  I make sure to eat here every trip to Vegas - the food and the service are impeccable.  Also love the Abita products these folks offer (both beer and root beer).\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Disappointing. The positives: top notch staff and service. They were knowledgeable, prompt and friendly. From the bartender who gave me a great suggestion for my Cabernet to our waiter who was very attentive.  Downside: completely bland decor. I'm used to steakhouses having a great classic feel that welcomes you in. This place was drab, and nothing special. As for our steaks, they were just ok; we expected much more. The heirloom tomatoes and burrata were a nice starter. But our overall experience was of a place we'd not return to. When you pay over $40 for a steak, it should be delicious.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Wow, is the first word that comes to mind when I think of the meal my husband and I ate here. The service was impeccable. Our waiter truly knows steaks and was able to answer all our questions. We had the filet, bone in ribeye, twice baked potato, and asparagus. They were all cooked to perfection and mouth watering. They place offers five star meals with five star service. Can't wait to return next time we are in Las Vegas.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We were served chicken skewers, prosciutto, and potstickers for appetizers. They were all delicious! \n",
      "\n",
      "Next we were served a delicious light salad! \n",
      "I was never disappointed by the service or food! Truly a five star restaurant\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Given the big name attached to this place (Emeril), and based on a friend's recommendation, I had high hopes. Sadly, the name here is just a facade for mediocre food and service.\n",
      "\n",
      "I made reservations via Yelp/OpenTable to treat my girl to a nice dinner on our first \"just us\" trip to Las Vegas.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a cold night and she had decided to wear a heavy coat. When we arrived, neither the host or hostess offered to take her coat. I then asked them to take her coat and they responded that Delmonico's doesn't offer a coat check. Strike one.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hostess seated us at a table that had obviously already been reserved for us, as two of the chairs at the four-person table had been removed. That was a small, but nice touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had expected Delmonico's to have a dress code, but there were plenty of patrons in jeans and polo shirts. I almost want to strike the restaurant for that, but I understand it is Vegas and they have to cater to a variety of customers. But it does take the ambiance down a notch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The waiter appeared promptly and introduced himself (Renee, I believe it was). I had to ask for the wine list. Why should I have to *ask* for the wine list? Strike two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Renee did not go over any of the specials with us. He also mentioned that two other servers would be assisting them, but he did so when they weren't there. So when one of them came by later, we had no idea which of the two assistants he was.\n",
      "\n",
      "The assistant pretty much took over at that point, and we only saw Renee once again (with the bill). The assistant asked to take our order before we even saw the wine list.\n",

      "Our food came out fairly quickly; almost too quickly. We had barely received the wine when our appetizers arrived. She had the lobster bisque which was very thin and only contained about 1oz of lobster. I had the duck prosciutto flatbread. The duck was overcooked and still had a layer of skin and fat that was rubbery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost instantly after we finished our appetizers, the main entrees arrived as if they had been waiting around the corner with the dishes to spring out as we took the last bites of our appetizers.\n",
      "\n",
      "She ordered the filet and I had the bone-in rib-eye. Both of the cuts were of good quality but were ruined by an over-seasoning of creole spices. Both steaks were ordered medium rare and came out cooked perfectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sides left much to be desired. Many of the choices were bland and uninspiring. The broccoli was simply steamed with no seasoning or oils added. The potato gratin contained too much garlic.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speed of the service and delivery of the meal was too fast. We finished dinner within 1 hour. Strike three.\n",
      "\n",
      "Total damage, including wine ($120 for the bottle) and tip, came to ~$340. We've had much, much better fine dining experiences (and food) for less.\n",

      "There are many better options available in Vegas.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] How could anyone give this place less than 5 stars.  The food is great.  Everything went perfectly.  I wish I could eat here everyday...  I usually split the Chateaubriand with a friend.  I would recommend Delmonico to everyone that wants an amazing experience with great food.\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] He may be a TV celebrity chef, but you can't take away credit where credit is due: Emeril is a fantastic restaurateur.  My wife and I have dined here twice; the first time because we were staying at the Venetian and the second time we purposely came back to eat here on one of our anniversaries while staying in Vegas.  In short this is a fantastic formal steakhouse experience all around.  What sold us was the Chateaubriand for two. Expertly cooked and finished off by table side with a flame of cognac for that over-the-top Vegas style experience.  Quite possibly one of the most memorable steaks we've had in our life. Tender with an explosion of flavor when you take a bite, mmm.  There are several wonderful side dishes you can choose to complement the meat and so far we haven't been disappointed in any of them whether you go for the vegetable of the day (garlic pan fried green beans the last time were there) or the bacon and cheddar grits, mashed potatoes, or baked potato. Oh and for your prerequisite greenery before the meat course they also do a fantastic Caesar salad prepared at table side for 2 as well.  Desert? Yes please!  You can't go wrong with their caramel cream brulee but everything on their dessert menu looked sweetly decadent.  I don't think I need bother describing the wine or drink menu here other than this is Vegas after all and if you possibly couldn't find what you're after here to complement your meal then I'm sure they could get it for you.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Yum! I loved this place! Order the Louisiana version of the Lemon drop! That is really good! The food was great! The mashed potatoes were awesome and my steak was great. It didn't get cooked the way I asked for it to be but it was good nonetheless. Our server was great and because it was my birthday, she gave me a chocolate martini on the house that was so good!!! I would definitely go again!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This is still a GOOD PLACE for steaks...  Since my last review, I've finally taken my boyfriend here for his birthday on May 21st, even though it was a day late, and he thought it was really good.  Given we had a lot of extra food, it was still a good dinner...  He loved the sides we had, and his cut of meat was perfect, as was mine as well...  Wish we could afford coming here ALL THE TIME, but I guess we'll have to see where our jobs will lead us...  Otherwise we may actually have to PAY to come to Vegas...  Still, to enjoy Emeril's steaks and his awesome food, it's most definitely worth it...  One day we'll try his fish house in MGM...\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Make sure to book a reservation!! Even with our 8:30 rez, we didn't get seated until 9:10. \n",
      "They were very accommodating though so I can't complain! The bone in rib eye and buffalo was TO DIE FOR. I was looking forward to the lamb based on the pictures that I saw, but it wasn't on the menu when I went there over the weekend. \n",
      "Bread + butter... Best.Ever.\n",

Scallops......sooo salty they were not edible. Filet was raw even though I ordered it medium. Manager was so sorry that they comped the scallops, comped dessert, and comped a salad. Our whole meal was basically wrong or ruined. I'm glad they comped, but still.......umm probably won't be back. Bummer :(\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] all i can say is WOW! I was in Vegas for many reasons and I wont get into them here, but this restaurant was amazing. the food was outstanding the the service was the best I've ever had. The atmosphere was very relaxing, and non pretentious. The appetizer that we had was fantastic! GO PRAWNS! and the steak was to die for. The several waiters that attended to us were extremely knowledgeable and the sommelie was top notch. If you ever get a chance to visit this place i highly recommend it! Emerile did a great job with this one.\n",

      "Delmonico's was one of the first fancy-schmanchy places I'd eaten at in Vegas. However the last time I ate there was close to five years ago and I've eaten at many other places since then. My husband was eager to try it out again to see if it was as good as he remembered it to be. \n",
      "In summary, I'd say the food was good, the service- not so much. \n",
      "We were lead to our table in the back of the restaurant and even though it was nearly 10:00 pm, the restaurant was really crowded. I was pretty surprised but perhaps this is part of the reason we didn't receive the greatest service. \n",
      "For the appetizer, I had ordered some sort of tomato salad thing from the specials that sounded really interesting. In fact, it was one of the items the server had recommended. However, about 5-10 minutes after ordering, the server came by and informed me they were out of it and asked me if I would like to order something else. The weird thing was, he wasn't apologetic at all, he simply said something along the lines of, \"We're out of that, do you want to get another salad?\" I'm not going to say he was downright rude but for a restaurant of this caliber, I definitely expected at the very least, some sort of apology. Perhaps even a free appetizer or dessert but perhaps I'm expecting too much? I settled on the salad with goat cheese and I do have to say it was delicious, one of the tastiest salads I can remember having in a long time. However, the journey in getting to that salad was a little bumpy. My husband had a pretty standard garden salad that I tasted and it was pretty good too. \n",
      "Another problem with our ordering is when I tried to order my filet and they asked how I wanted it cooked, I told them my usual method of between medium and medium well, no blood. Okay, I know I am a little difficult but I've never had a problem with a place accommodating my request so at a high end steakhouse, I did not even consider that this would be a difficult task. Well, our server just flat out said he didn't think he could do that. Uhhh, what? Really? It's as if the steak was being cooked in a microwave with only set levels. It was so weird. So I was a little miffed. With that being said, my steak and my husband's steak was cooked properly when it came out. Just a shame that I had to get hazed about it when ordering. All our sides (grits, mushrooms, and spinach) had very generous portions and were pretty good too but perhaps but no real standouts either. \n",
      "Even though the steaks were a few dollars pricier than other comparable steakhouse such as Carnevino, I did appreciate that the three steak sauces came free. Other places charge $2-$3 per sauce so it really balanced out and it was nice to try all three. \n",
      "I can never resist dessert so I got something I believed was some sort of banana tart. I was surprised when something resembling a big hunk of mud pie with a giant mound of whip cream came out. I took a few bites but it was a bit overwhelming for me. \n",
      "All in all, I would say the food was good but not as good as I remembered it five years ago. Or perhaps I've been spoiled by the different restaurants I've been to since then. My biggest complaint was the service- not only the issues as stated above but just overall, the service felt impersonal and disjointed. I would have to guess that since the restaurant seemed very busy and it was near the end of the night by the time of our reservation, the servers had probably run out of patience. Understandable, we've all had bad days at work but I don't like feeling like the scapegoat. \n",
      "I still wouldn't hesitate in recommending Delmonico's to people since my food was good but perhaps I'd recommend a reservation earlier in the day and hope that would alleviate the service issues.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] wonderful decor and ambiance.  simple, modern and elegant.  comfy chairs too.   as others have stated the restaurant is a little loud (which I liked) but the tables are spaced comfortably apart so you can still enjoy an intimate dinner.  \n",
      "\n",
      "stellar service.  John and his group were attentive without being snooty and overbearing.  we felt comfortable.  i don't think there was ever a moment when our glasses reached half empty glass before they addressed it.  any little crumbs on the table were quickly taken care of.  definitely the service I was expecting from a top notch Vegas establishment.\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Soo pricey but what a delicious meal.  My filet was a perfect medium rare and the spices they had for the charring made it one of the best steaks i've had in my life\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Oh dear. Our anniversary dinner here was amazing. We shared the oysters Rockefeller, which had this great buttery panko topping.

      "Food\n",
      "- The popovers, to start, were good but I was disappointed that no other bread was offered, which is usually the case with steakhouses.\n",
      "- The word that comes to mind when describing the quality of the filet is mediocre. It looked like it had been pulverized with a meat mallet. Pretty bland and not juicy at all.\n",
      "- My friend did enjoy his pork chop and it looked much better than my steak. \n",
      "- The twice baked potato was a big disappointment given that the bottom of it felt rock hard and the whipped potato on top was bland.\n",
      "- The fried apple pies were adequate. My friend really liked the pecan pie.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Yes Yes Yes! I'm probably repeating all the great things people said already but it is true. My husband and I were there this past weekend and we were satisfied 100%! And after reading the reviews I'm not sure why people minus the 5th star because of the price. In my opinion if you are looking for an amazing fine dining experience you must be wiling to spend the money. We were here for about three hours and we enjoyed every bit of it. We let our waiter know in advance that we were in no rush and he made sure to plan the timing of our appetizers and main just right. We were watching the blue man group after dinner and wanted to drink a few drinks before we left.\n",

      "Every time we went to the bathroom they folded our napkins, refilled our drinks before we even had time to ask, and our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu --- that alone just shows the attention to detail. In addition to the lobster bisque, french escargot, cream corn gratinne, creole gulf shirmp cocktail...:) I had the hot Alaskan King Crab Legs and my husband had the Bone in RibEye. He said \"it is the best steak he has ever had\" ( please take in consideration that we had travel all over the world).  The noise was moderate, besides I'm in Vegas and I wanted to dine in a lively and happy place not a quiet boring place.  Even though the dining room was open it is still cozy and romantic and easy to have a private conversation.  \n",

The best thing there was the service. The team that waits on your table is awesome. But for the food... The foie gras was good... The Caesar salad was okay, too much dressing but good flavor, the creamed corn tasted good but had too much breeding, the grits are not  grits... More like risotto. My husbands ribeye was only okay and for the price it should have been better. The macnut bread pudding and the banana cram pie... Stay away they are NOT good. And I think the most disappointing thing was the gumbo... It tasted like crap. I have been to the south and expected better gumbo from him.\n",

      "We get there, and there is a private party going on - but in the lobby/bar/wait area.  What?  That's a bit disturbing.  They sat us in the lounge area and we ordered drinks (which never came).  Then our \"table\" was ready.  Well this was the end table which basically was in the lounge area.  So we moved over one table. \n",
      "\n",
      "The wine list is very in depth and almost overwhelming.  Just give me a good red with my meat is not the way to go here.  No simplicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the start our table was crowded.  Too many items on the tables, and the service ware was oversized for the little table.  It almost made it difficult to eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before our food came I wondered off to the loo - which was like a hike because the restaurant is actually quite huge.  As I walked by tables, I saw several larger tables with less people seated at them and empty chairs.  Hmmm.  So they really couldn't let me bring an extra guest or they really don't know how to plan their seating?  \n",
      "\n",
      "During our meal we couldn't even talk - the noise from the private party was too much.  And they were standing all around us.  Several time people knocked into the back of my clients' chair!  So frustrating.  I can't understand WHY they would seat people in that area - and we had plenty of room for the extra guest.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The food was wonderful.  Meat done right.  But all the negatives earn this only 2 stars.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] hands down the best steak I have ever had. Frog legs were really good too. Service was perfect and it made for an amazing evening.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Las Vegas has steak houses everywhere you look.  Delmonico Steakhouse is one of the better ones.  I ate dinner at the bar, where a full menu is available.  Overall the meal was very good:  very good foie gras; an excellent bone-in rib eye steak with three sauces (barnaise, A-OK [like a fancy version of A-1], and a third sauce that I liked but can't remember anything about); bananas Foster ice cream pie that was good but not to die for.  A number of wines are available by the glass.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Had a business lunch here with a few folks - very important meeting and they took great care of us. Like most places in the big hotels on the Strip, the service was impeccable. I had the fried chicken and black eye peas, very tasty. Not sure I'd go here if it wasn't a business meal, but overall I was impressed.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The Japanese Wagyu steak is so tender...it melts in your mouth! It is the best Wagyu in town! Love the bone in rib eye and escargot here so I would come back!!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This place is amazing!!!! Came here for an annual post-Christmas celebratory dinner and we were pleased with the food as well as the service. They served us a complimentary tomato mousse on a puff pastry to start and for being a single bite, it was packed full of flavor! I knew we were in for a treat. Ordered steak tartare for an appetizer and fell in love. It comes with an egg yolk over the top which gives it a wonderful velvety taste. Decent portion although I could have eaten much more. Next we shared the tomato and burrata salad. The burrata was the best I've had....so creamy and rich. Delicious! For our entree, we shared the Chateaubriand. Holy crap was it amazing! The first bite literally melted in my mouth. It's served with asparagus which was super fresh and crisp. We substituted fingerling potatoes for the mashed potatoes and were very happy with our decision. We also added foie gras, which was delicious. I seriously could eat the steak ever day though.... It's one of the best I've ever had. For dessert, we were interested in the bread pudding but went with the suggestion of 2 different servers and ordered the pecan pie. Holy shit it was incredible. Not your typical pecan pie....it's made with oats and love and magic. It was the perfect end to a fantastic meal. We come to Vegas and splurge on a nice dinner once a year, typically going somewhere new each time, but there's a chance we'll make a repeat visit next year. The service was on point throughout...the staff is knowledgeable and friendly, not stuffy or arrogant at all like some places. Thank you, Delmonico!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] What a beautiful evening!!  The restaurant is very nice - you can get dressed up or be fine in jeans and a jacket.  The staff was unpretentious and welcoming.  The food was delicious and the staff made every attempt to ensure our experience was fantastic.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] By far the best steak I have ever had. We had dinner here to celebrate a friend's birthday. They met a few requirement we needed, a late reservation and corkage. Most places in Vegas don't do corkage and he was super attached to the wine that he brought. \n",
      "    The service was incredible. They were so attentive and well versed when it came to the menu. Out of the 6 people we had with us 5 were or are in the food industry. The man was an executive chef and the rest are fine dinning servers. Our servers kept them very happy. \n",
      "   The man and I shared the Cesar salad for two prepared table side. I had the Fillet Oscar style. It was honestly the best steak I had ever had. They were very generous with the crab and asparagus. The rest of our party dinned on rib eye, pork chop and the day's specials. It was all amazing. We finished off the meal with a banana creme pie. I don't really like banana cream. This was outstanding. Real sliced bananas with fresh creme, my god! \n",
      "   When the bill came were pleasantly surprised at how reasonable it was. A little over $500 for 6 people and 3 bottles of wine.  \n",
      "I can't wait to go back!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The thing about fine dining establishments is that there's a heck of a chance you'll leave without having had your fill, so you're encouraged to empty your wallet even more for all the trimmings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't make that mistake at Delmonico Steakhouse, even if everything looks and is delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost everything at Emeril's restaurant here is sharable.  I was here for a couple friends' birthdays, and everybody at my table ordered one appetizer to go with the steaks we ordered.  As good as everything was, we just ended up staring at our food 20 minutes after being served.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the food, as I stated, it's all terrific.  The complimentary bread is some of the best I've ever had.  They're delicate to the touch, and when you bite into it, the texture is flakier than a croissant.  I didn't even know that was possible with a roll.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I had the lobster bisque as an appetizer, which was creamy and some decent chunks of lobster in it.  For the record, I actually finished it.  Another person at our table ordered the seafood tower which is something you should get on a big baller budget, but everything from the oysters, to the lobster, and crab claws were scrumptious.  The country smashed potatoes, sauteed garlic mushrooms, truffle parmesan potato chips, and duck fat fingerling potatoes?  All amazing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the steak.  Most of them are dry-aged, so we're talking $$$ here, but like my fellow Yelper Ferdinand L. said, do not attempt to have a steak without the foie gras on top.  If you've never had foie gras before, this is the time to do it.  The result is something you'll simply salivate over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now it wasn't the best steak I ever had, but it was one of those situations where after eating here, I know most things after will be a disappointment, so choose your next meal wisely.  My whole table had the meat stares, and only one person at the table finished their entree.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just a great dining experience.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] we are a repeat customer-- best service - Thx Tom!!! Best NY steak, Ribeye---unbelievable flavor. Great Kir Royale.  Unbelievable Banana Cream Pie.  This has to be best restaurant in vegas\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Went here with a large group. Good steak.  Sides were only decent. Overall a 4 star meal.  I would go back if asked, but would not plan the meal here. There is better in town.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Delmonicos is a great restaurant, there is no doubt about that. I ordered a Bone in Rib eye medium rare.  The steak was cooked to perfection.  I felt it lack the salt and pepper seasoning on the crust.  I ended up having to get some finishing salt to give it a little more flavor.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I will go there again if I stay at the Palazzo, but I still have a preference to a couple other steaks houses.  service was great, food was great. just thought the steak could have been a little better seasoned.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] If you are looking for the best steak you have had, and a fine dining experience, the team at Delmonicos will not let you down.  We had the table side Caesar and the rib-eye and filet, and we were in heaven.  Go here!!!!!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This place was amazing, probably the best meal I have ever had in my life.  I came here with my boyfriend at the time, for an early dinner.  We arrived earlier than our reservation, so while we were waiting we were looking at the menu outside to see what we would have. \n",
      "\n",
      " I thought I had made my decision, but once inside we found out that the chef makes something special each day.  So of course this is what I decided on ordering, and so did he.  Which I was a little bummed because I was hoping he would order something different so we can share.  Our dish was served in a large bowl, and it was a sampling of pork, beef and chicken that was served over garlic mash potatoes.   We also ordered the caesar salad prepared table side.  This was very impressive and of course delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "For desert I chose the banana cream pie and he chose the double chocolate fudge cake.  They were both superb, which I wasn't expecting any less.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service is impeccable.  I have never been to a restaurant this nice and I felt like a queen for the time that we were there.  There were just two of us, but be had three servers attending our table.  While we were waiting to be seated we sat in the bar and we were watching a basketball game.  The maitre d' noticed and kept us updated throughout our dinner with the score.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Great steaks, awesome service and comfortable settings.  This is a steakhouse, don't expect too much other then steakhouse classics and wonderful desserts.  Food is good, not amazing, would return for sure.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Great steakhouse! The best I've had since I've been living here in Vegas! Excellent service! I loved how the waiters and the chef that night wanted to listen to people's opinions of the dishes. Right when we arrived, they allowed us to sample an appetizer on the house, and the waiters asked for our opinion about it. It was a flaky chicken salad puff of some sort, and it was delicious! The side dishes I had were the mushrooms and asparagus. Scrumptious! As for the steak....SUPERB!  I had the steak in the bone (forgot the real name), and it was really good! My goodness! The environment is very dim but elegant. Fancy dining, for sure. I will always love that the waiters are wearing suits and always ask your opinion about every dish you try! They were even nice enough to give me a cute little chocolate dessert for my birthday for free! I love Delmonicos!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Had the bone-in ribeye. It was good but not knock my sox off good. I can't give 5 stars because i thought pricing was a bit high and quality wasn't up there with the pricing.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Worth the cost.\n",
      "The food is amazing.  We ordered steaks and shared lots of pasta and other appetizers.  It is the meal I want to have before dying.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ended up in a worse table location bc we were pretty late, but they still got us in.  Also, the spot we were at was cold bc of a draft and they quickly fixed the problem.\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] It has been a few years since my 1 and only visit. I recall it being highly overrated. I am from Texas and have been to many steakhouses. First of all, the high-end white tablecloth fancy decor with everyone in suits and ties is not fitting for a steakhouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "The steaks were not memorable and I have had much better for less money.  I do not recall if the steaks are grilled or broiled but I do recall mine was overcooked and for such a high-end fancy place, I would expect better.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are looking for quality steak in Vegas and willing to spend some cash, I would try many others before this place.\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Celebrated my daughter's birthday here as it was her desire to dine here again, and everything was fabulous! My daughter & my husband shared the Chateaubriand with asparagus & mashed potatoes, and I ordered the Filet Mignon Au Poivre which was wonderful... Starters equalled Lobster Bisque & Butternut Squash Ravioli which were excellent as well... Impeccable service & the highest Quality food & preparation were greatly appreciated for a special occasion for our family! Thank you for a memorable evening!\n",
      "Banana Cream Pie for Bday dessert was ridiculously great & enough for many to share!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Impressive table side carved steak. Probably the best dessert I've had thus far....The Banana cream pie\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Delmonico is located within the Venetian on the casino floor. \n",
      "\n",
      "The ambiance is elegant and classy. This restaurant is great for a beautiful and romantic dinner. There may be a wait if you have not made reservations so make sure to call ahead and reserve a corner table (for people watching of course). - Not for the food.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was great! If my review were only for the service this would be an easy 5 star rating. There are two main servers, plus water, and wine servers as well. I always love this added touch because it makes for better service. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now to the real rating. The FOOD (insert dramatic music in background).\n",
      " \n",
      "Let's just say the bill came out to roughly $300 and we were not the least bit impressed. \n",
      "The only notable item was the wine which was delicious, very smooth, a quaint merlot to go well with our steaks.. \n",
      "That was about it though.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mashed potatoes were too globby,  the mushrooms were simply made in a butter sauce that tasted, well, tasted buttery. \n",
      "There was no essence action and considering this steakhouse is a reflection of Emeril- I'm not impressed. Where's the flavor Emeri?!? \n",
      "My steak was ordered medium - my steak came out well done and tough. There were no add ons to compliment the steak, perhaps a dry rub, a sauce maybe? I asked for lemon to zest my steak, considering I still had every intention of eating it  (Yes, hunger is real when you're in Vegas on the weekend).. but what disappointed me the most were the cocktail lemon wedges which I received from our server.. \n",
      "It was more of an, \"Are you kidding me? Delmonico cannot afford to add simple cheesecloth, or a gauze socks around half lemons and here I am cashing out 300 bucks!?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I try my best to give each business the best reflection possible, but in all fairness Delmonico greatly lagged. I have definitely had better steak, better sides, and most definitely better dessert elsewhere- most of all a steak that is served with proper sides of lemon!\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, incase you do end up here please also skip the chocolate cake. The pistachio ice cream does not compliment this desert one bit. I'm still in awe of the ratings others have given this restaurant. The food is off, and in all fairness at the end of the day I cannot EAT the service. I prefer actual tangible, consumable, well dressed and cooked morsels of, yep you got it, FOOD. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry Yelpers- but this restaurant is not worth a return. 2 Stars.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Came here to eat dinner and everything for the most part was delicious. I got the bonein ribeye cooked medium rare. It was perfectly cooked and I was satisfied. It's pretty big but I still finished mines cause it was bomb. Ordered a bunch of sides too which were good. Nothing too special about them. However don't order the chicken my sister doesn't really eat red meat so she ordered it and it was dry. We ordered two desserts the banana cream pie and the butter cake. Both were good but the banana cream pie was exceptional! All in all it was a good experience and the food was worth the price\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We have been twice now, and really enjoy Delmonico. It's the little things in service - for example, my friend was wearing a black skirt, and they took away her napkin. She was confused and asked for a napkin and they said oh, we're grabbing you a black one. Just so that she didn't get white threads on her skirt... \n",
      "\n",
      "The lobster bisque is AMAZING - best I've had, anywhere EVER. The bread is also crazy delicious! It's these weird puffy rolls that are so flaky and good. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had filet which is normally excellent. I did have one time where for some reason mine was medium and my friend's was medium rare, though we had ordered opposite. We didn't care much though and just switched our steaks :-)  I think they confused the orders in the kitchen. \n",
      "\n",
      "The service is great - we had Michael Jackson (for real, that was his name) last night and he was super helpful and friendly. \n",
      "\n",
      "Oh yeah and the bread pudding. OMG... \n",
      "\n",
      "For the lobster bisque, the bread and bread pudding (plus service) I would give it five starts. The four is because though the steaks are good, I have admittedly had many that are much better. I would still absolutely go back (and really enjoy it) I just can't say it's a \"to die for\" steak.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Recently had lunch here with my small work crew (3 of us) to celebrate the Holidays. The restaurant was completely dead mid-week so at first I thought maybe we'd made a terrible mistake. My fears were quickly assuaged as our food started arriving. We ordered the lobster sliders as an appetizer to share between two of us, and our other colleague had the lobster bisque. The lobster sliders? Well they are the things dreams are made of, I'm still salivating over them weeks later. Lobster bisque was also apparently outstanding. Fries with old bay, perfectly cooked and tasty. For our entrees, two of us each had the grilled skirt steak sandwich and the other had the steak salad. The steak sandwich and truffle fries were absolutely delicious and I hear the salad was really fantastic. Service was impeccable and obviously we had the restaurant to ourselves, so our every need was catered to perfectly. I definitely will be back.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Walked in on a Sunday evening, no reservations. Portion sizes are excellent especially for the price and the upscale vibe. Was thinking it was going to be small portions, but not so. The bone-in ribeye and their special of the day, bison short rib, were delicious and cooked to perfection. Would definitely come back. Very trendy busy, but worth the experience: excellent.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This place was delicious and the staff was very friendly and helpful.  My favorite favorite thing was the Lobster Bisque.  It had a empanada like thing in the soup packed with lobster. \n",
      "\n",
      "If only I could find that here....\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Ok, be prepared to shell out some money, not cheap!  The setting and wait staff was very nice.  Wine selection was very good, but typical restaurant pricing.  Food was fantastic,  had the lobster bisque, ribeye with broccoli and baked potato. Everything was cooked just as ordered. A must steak house!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Holy smokes we loved this place!!\n",
      "From the homemade potato chips with truffle oil to the BBQ prawns, oysters, herb fillet, halibut, and desert. This place was absolutely delicious. The service was great also. Merill beat Colicchio hands down....\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I had such high expectations for Delmonico's because I love Emeril and because of him my culinary skills are on point but sadly I couldn't give this restaurant the 5 stars I wanted too. The staff was extremely friendly and nice. They gave excellect table service and I didn't have to ask for anything. \n",
      "\n",
      "We started our meal with some drinks. I ordered the Brooklyn Yard and my god this gin and juice concoction was so amazing I had two which is alot for this lightweight. We also ordered the BBQ Shrimp and Crispy Fried Oysters and as expected it was heavenly and I savored every bite. \n",
      "\n",
      "For dinner I ordered off the Summer Trio menu and chose the New Orleans Gumbo, the Sirloin Strip Steak with Asparagus and the Caramel Butter Cake with Vanilla Cream. The gumbo was just alright. It was good but I felt the roux was too rich and over powered the other ingredients. Although this made me sad I can honestly say I make a kick ass gumbo that taste better but I owe that in part to the many episodes of Emeril Live I've watched, lol. The Sirloin Strip Steak was cooked perfectly but it was lacking in flavor. It tasted like plain meat, no BAM and it was definitely not kicked up a notch. But the Caramel Butter Cake with Vanilla Cream made up for the steak. It was everything a butter cake is suppose to be, buttery, fluffy and just delicious goodness. Because I am a heifer I ordered the Banana Cream Pie too as this is a signature dessert of Delmonico's and the server sweared it was the best dessert on the menu. He lied, lol. It was good but the Caramel Butter Cake was much better. \n",
      "\n",
      "Although I didn't have a five star experience I will be back to give Delmonico's another try.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Ohhh where to being....maybe I should start from the judgment from the host? Probably not a good idea to rudely look at people when they enter. Or maybe you shouldn't have a server who asked a personal question about my tattoos? Or maybe when he tried to get me and the 5 other girls to go to his part time job at TAO, then proceeded to ask me if I had another shirt because \"I don't think they'd let you get in with a wife beater,\" because I'm wearing a tank top that isn't up to your personal standards. Hmmmm as an ex server there is NO WAY IN HELL I WOULD EVER TALK TO ANYONE LIKE THAT. Maybe in this gentlemans mind I am not good enough to be at his job, where he works to get paid, to probably help raise his family. Let everyone know beforehand that their is a prerequisite to even be acceptable in this restaurant. Yes I can wear tank tops, and yes I'm a woman I have breasts but to be stared down and then judge how I'm dressed is ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE.\n",
      "\n",
      "My entire dining experience was ruined. Why would I want to spend $134 on some wine and food just to be judged? For that I leave the server no tip and I promise I will never tell anyone about this restaurant based on experience alone. My friends told me how great it was and after 10 minutes I was embarrassed and self conscious. Thanks for wasting my money, time and what could have been a good experience. I cannot fathom how these people get trained...\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Pretty pricey, but the food is good. Tried escargot for the first time here, and I was impressed. It is an OK place to eat alone, but would be better with a special someone. Nice atmosphere.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The food was okay/good and service was great.  The service made our okay meal a better experience. When my bf and I were first seated, we were asked if we were celebrating anything. We told them our anniversary and was served a complimentary amuse-bouche and sorbet dessert at the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yay:\n",
      "-Truffle Parmesan potato chips: freshly made and amazing in flavor. You can taste all the elements of this working well together. I thought the truffle oil was going to overwhelm the dish but it was nicely perfumed throughout and complimented the freshly grated Parmesan. The chips were thin, crispy and airy. I almost ate the whole thing before my meal but had to stop myself. \n",
      "\n",
      "Other:\n",
      "-Ribeye steak special: the special of the day was a petite rib eye with foie gras. The steak otherwise would have been bland had it not been for the foie gras. It was perfectly cooked to my medium rare preference. \n",
      "-Ribeye: my bf got the regular ribeye without the special and it come out to be almost the same size as my petite filet. It was slightly seasoned more than mine. However when we reheated the leftover steaks, mine held up better and the foie gras melted into the meat flavoring it better than this one. \n",
      "-Mashed potatoes: just regular, nothing fancy.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This is my third time I would say in the last 6 years that I have eaten here. Celebrated my brother-in-laws 30th birthday and the STEAKS were awesome. I had the bone-in New York steak medium. It had a perfect char and cooked how a steak needs to be. I am a big fan of the New York because it is a leaner cut. The bone-in Ribeye steak medium rare was what my brother-in-law had and that just melted like butter in your mouth. The creme of corn was outstanding!  The Smashed potatoes were fine. Overall experience was superb and the service has never failed me.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Ahhh. Delmonico. I always make a point to visit this restaurant when I am in Nevada, for this is my favorite steakhouse. The ambience is quite dim, and the overall atmosphere simple and elegant.\n",
      "\n",
      "We started out with the truffle and parmesan chips as well as the pork trotter. The chips= simply AMAZING. The chip was light and airy, yet when you bite into it, you get the perfect combination of truffle oil and crisp potato. The pork trotter was also good, but I believe that it was better the last time I came.\n",

      "As for the steak, I ordered their signature bone-in ribeye with a side of spinach. The steak came with butter on top, which I found different because not many other steakhouses included that. The steak was delicious; and i was able to finish it without problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I was too full for dessert, and did not have the opportunity to see the desert menu. Last time when I was here, I remember the peach or apple (some fruit) tart with ice cream was the best.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I'll start this review off for you skimmers out there that don't read long reviews. The bone-in rib-eye is the greatest steak experience you will ever have, hands down. Just eat it. Go. Do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now for you that are still with me, here's my full-on, cash money, baller review...for what it's worth:\n",
      "\n",
      "Delmonico must have a good database manager behind the scenes, because it had been a long time since my last dinner there (prob 5-6 years), yet they immediately greeted me and remembered my patronage (2 visits prior).  What a great feeling (and rather impressive to my gf) that the host and hostess and wait-staff greet you like you're a goddamn king touring the countryside. \n",
      "\n",
      "This trip to Las Vegas was during a getaway weekend and to see long time friends, but we had a little dinner the night before some festivities for just us. I wanted to visit Delmonico again, because I had remembered such a positive experience with food and service the times before.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we are greeted by the sommelier and our lead waiter, who throw out a few drinks and possible pairings, review the specials, roll over some changes in the menu (all from memory mind you). We knew we were eating steaks and heartier dishes, so we opted for a bottle of a good Sonoma Cab Sauv we recognized.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The chef paid his compliments with an amuse bouche' of a olive oiled crustini with duck fat and a mushroom.  It was a delicious little oily, fatty, salty bite that told the taste buds \"hey bitches...I'm comin' for you...get ready!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We were treated to some hot brioche popovers and full-fat butter, and I had to oblige at least one...cannot say no...(it's completely un-American to pass up on such things).\n",
      "\n",
      "We decided to start the evening by sharing an heirloom tomato and burrata cheese salad (faux caprese), and a table-side Lobster bisque. The salad was graciously split onto two plates for us, and was perfectly portioned with greens, veg, cheese, and a light dressing (that was not overpowering). The bisque was poured at our table with huge chunks of lobster, and a smooth velvet-like texture. Flavors were perfect and the temp was outstanding. I had mine and finished my gf's (she always worries about getting to full before the main meal comes).\n",
      "\n",
      "I had ordered the bone-in rib-eye au poivre and my lady chose the Filet Medallions. I must impress upon you again that the Bone-in Rib-eye IS the way to go. It is perfectly broiled at high temp, with amazing peppercorn seasoning and having it with the mushrooms sauce and onions is the bomb-sauce. There is nothing like it. It is a HUGE cut of meat, with great crusting outside, perfect marbling, and the bone-in flavor. The hot-reddish/pink medium to medium-rare center makes for a tender, juicy, and magnificent steak.  I honestly didn't even partake of her medallions much, because I didn't need to, and wouldn't cheat on my rib-eye.  I let the lady try some of mine and she immediately agreed its the best steak, anywhere, ever. We had a side of asparagus as well, which I felt very bad for because I gave it very little love. I hate leaving soldiers on the battlefield but I wanted to win the war with that steak and had a long night ahead of me of shows and clubs and didn't want terrible meat sweats...so I had to be courteous of tummy room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we've effectively covered food, let me give a swag at the service. Top notch. All the way around. Polite, informed, friendly, attentive enough without being intrusive. Well-trained veteran folks throughout...no schmucks looking to hump tables as a side gig, these are true to form, real career servers who take pride in their appearance, their posture, plating, timing, knowledge, and truly love their career...these folks work years before graduating to a place like Delmonico or Craftsteak, etc. These guys get huge tips and get to work with fine chefs in multi-million dollar restaurants...they're the cream of the wait staff crop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Total wine, apps, dinner (no dessert, saved room for later on) was what I expected at ~$300. Well worth it to treat ourselves and enjoy a top-notch meal.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Look folks, even if you're not an Emeril fan (yes he owns the Delmonico name), you can still love this place. A) he's no longer the executive chef of either location, B) the experience is always good here and the place stands alone on its merits, and C) that damned rib-eye is scheduled for my last meal on planet Earth (someday). \n",
      "\n",
      "Trust me folks...when in Vegas...eat like a damned king. Treat yourself to amazing service, amazing food, and good times...ENJOY!!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My husband and I dined here for my 40th birthday. We were treated like royalty and loved every minute. He had the chateaubriand and I had the salmon. Both were incredible. I can't wait to visit Vegas again just to eat here!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Loved this place! The waiter was very knowledgable to my gluten allergy! He made my dining experience wonderful!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] WOW.\n",

      "I came to Vegas searching for their best steak and I think I might have found it.  The dining experience overall was spectacular.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I purposely starved myself all day and did tons of walking throughout the day so by the time we were seated at our table, I was ready to rip into it.  The only thing I eyeballed was their bone-in rib eye.  Ordered it medium rare.  The first bite was perfect.  So much flavor and it just melted in my mouth.  Not only was the food great, the service was as well!  \n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks Delmonico for making my last night in Vegas dining experience a memorable one!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] First off the service here is top notch, very welcoming and friendly. Servers here make you feel like they genuinely care about if you're enjoying your meal. \n",

      "Ambiance is very classy and  slightly dim which is perfect.  Dress to impress!\n",
      "\n",
      "Appetizer \n",
      "BBQ Shrimp - these were super tasty with Cajun spices and the shrimp sit it a nice broth. Shrimps were cooked perfectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meals:\n",
      "Filet Mignon-cooked and seasoned perfectly juicy and full of flavor.  Good crust on the outside. \n",
      "\n",
      "Rack of Lamb- very disappointing,  I've ordered lamb at other top restaurants with no problems but this one has way too much fat the first 3 pieces I cut were 85% fat.  I was a little bummed and I hardly ever mention dissatisfaction or send a plate back but my gf urged me since we are paying top $$ for our meals.  \n",
      "Without hesitation after mentioning how the lamb was not up to par the manager. immediately came out inspected the lamb and agreed it was more fatty then usual and allowed me to swap out my lamb with a bone in NY Strip. \n",
      "The strip was cooked beautifully! Good crust on the outside and perfect medium rare on inside not to mention flavor was om point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sides: (here's where I knock down a star)\n",
      "Creamed spinach- was good but not great it lacked a little bit of flavor and a bit bland. \n",
      "\n",
      "Au Gratin- see above with creamed spinach.  It lacked that wow factor and was a little runny. \n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the sub par sides the filet and NY strip were both excellent and the impeccable service makes me give 4 stars. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cheers \n",
      "\n",
      "PS cocktails were good a little on the strong side which I like but not too strong to make you cringe,  good flavor.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] 7 girls, after a long 4 hour drive, arrived at the Venetian on a mission for some hearty steak.  Delmonico was the answer to our problem.  We were so exhausted that we didn't even bother pretty-ing ourselves up before hand...dumped out bags and headed straight to dinner.  We were worried that our shorts and flip-flop attire wasn't going to cut it but aside from some dirty stares from some of the other guests, the wait staff kindly turned their heads.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The service was impeccable.   They started us off with a goat cheese puff pastry to cleanse our pallets, compliments of the chef.  All of us buddied up and ordered the Bone-in Ribeye Steak...which was plenty to go around.  Tasty, it sure was but I'd have to say, I've had better.  The garlic mushrooms, creamed corn, cheddar bacon grits, and sauteed asparagus sides were great compliments set in the middle of the table for all of us to share.  We were seated at a circular table which was ideal for conversation instead of screaming across a long table.  By dessert, we were stuffed...next time for sure.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Since we didn't order any wine to compliment the dinners that we all split, Delmonico left the robbing of our $$ to the casinos.  I know if I went with just my boyfriend, it'd be one less night we could stay at the Venetian.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I'm almost always skeptical of anything with a celebrity chef's name because they're almost always underwhelming. Those types of establishments require that celebrity chef to attach their name to drive new customers. In this business (which I'm far from expert, but know what I like), it's word of mouth that should ultimately drive good cuisine.\n",
      "\n",
      "My father told me to come here while I was in town and I'm so glad that I did. Vegas is full of traps and this one was not a trap at all, and if it was a trap I wandered in willingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"Book of Whisky\" is MASSIVE. Largest whisky/single malt/irish/worldwide whiskey list I've ever seen. I partook in a nice Yamazaki 12 (world renowned shit) and felt adventurous and tried an Amrut from India which was delectable and spicy as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "The STEAK. I put it up there with Toro Toro as #1/#2 of all time. Flavorful, crunchy char, a nice butter sauce that only Emeril himself can probably cook up, and the service to match.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sat at the bar and my server was knowledgeable, attentive, and would come around the bar to take care of me which was unnecessary, but appreciated. Great ambience as well, very low key for Vegas, and elegant.\n",
      "\n",
      "My new MUST DINE spot in Vegas. Will be back forever.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I'm struggling to figure out why I am rating this four stars instead of five. I guess that five stars is perfection and nothing is perfect, right? \n",
      "\n",
      "We (me, wife, and my parents) at here on Sunday, August 2, at 7:00. We reserved via OpenTable and were promptly seated in a very nice location. Even though the restaurant was busy the tables on either side of us were kept empty until we were leaving, which was a very nice touch. My wife and I, and my parents, were celebrating our wedding anniversaries, and I noted this with OpenTable. This was communicated to the restaurant and they treated us very nice. \n",
      "\n",
      "The service was extremely good. Each table is assigned three people: a head waiter, an assistant waiter, and a buser. All were very polite and professional. The buser was a bit green but that is OK; her mistakes were very minor. The head waiter was exceptional - I don't remember his name and I feel bad for not being able to call him out and recognize him here. The second waiter was also very good; again, I forget her name. \n",
      "\n",
      "Very good bread was brought to the table and a complimentary appetizer was served to us that consisted of a very yummy chicken salad. My wife and I ordered the table-side Caesar salad and it was worth the $30. The table-side preparation is neat to watch, and she did a great job with it. The entire salad is made from scratch at the table. This Caesar goes right to the top of my list as my very favorite Caesar and almost makes up for the beat-down I got at the Palazzo's craps table right before dinner. My dad ordered a shrimp cocktail that looked excellent. \n",
      "\n",
      "My dad and I both had the boneless rib eye and my mom and wife split the filet. It was all good; in fact, I could have used a smaller steak. The waiter said it was 14-16 ounces but this was definitely bigger. For sides we ordered the asparagus, which I don't eat, and the small potatoes with garlic, which were very good. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had a root beer float for dessert - I liked the fact that there were some old favorites on the dessert menu, including peach cobbler. \n",
      "\n",
      "With two bottles of wine (at $65/bottle) we spent over $400 (before tip) on dinner but all agreed that it was money well spent. \n",
      "\n",
      "About the only negative is the couple who brought a very small child (6 months?) into the restaurant with them. The baby wasn't doing well and cried somewhat - shame on the parents.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Had an all around fine meal at Delmonico on our recent trip to Las Vegas.  I also went to Wolfgang Puck's CUT and gave it 4 stars on this trip.  The only real difference was that Delmonico cooked my NY Strip perfectly medium rare vs. just a bit over at Puck's place.  The rest of the meal from service to apps to salads was first rate.  The gumbo was yummy with a dark brick roux used and plenty of chicken, seafood and andouille to complement.  They put a big ole hunk of Maitre d butter on each steak and this, along with the Cajun seasoning (am assuming Emeril's trademark Essence) and the natural juices from the prime, aged beef lead to a wonderful liquid on your plate for dipping each tender bite.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service was as attentive and on point as one would expect at these prices.  Sorry Wolfgang, Emeril wins this showdown by .5 of a star!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My now fiancé took me here to celebrate after he proposed. I swear my starry eyes didn't affect the taste, it was incredible on its own. \n",
      "\n",
      "Started with delicious Krug champagne and oysters. I really appreciated quality oysters after having some sub-par ones the night before at a buffet. \n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend ordered the lobster bisque and I should have too. I ended up having a bit of his, it is NOT to be missed. We almost put in another order. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the filet and he the bone-in ribeye. Both were delicious, and even though they are famous for the ribeye I liked the filet more. It was so lean and tender, cooked perfectly medium rare, but it was that charring on the outside that gave it this incredible flavor. The ribeye was fantastic too, it had a completely different flavor. My man preferred his ribeye so it worked perfectly. Honestly can't say a bad thing about either. \n",
      "\n",
      "They sent us a house mad sherbet to celebrate our engagement, and we finished with divine espresso. \n",
      "\n",
      "My fiancé and I agree this was the most delicious and flawless meal we have shared. We will definitely return every time we come to Vegas.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Outstanding.  The bone-in ribeye was cooked perfectly and totally delicious. The bar has the best whiskey selection I've seen.  Service was prompt, and we had an amazing time.  Awesome meal, exactly as it should be.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My first 5 star rating. \n",
      "I can't think of a single area that deserves less. I'm just gonna leave it at that. Go try it out and you may be lucky enough to have Michael Jackson Jr. as your guide. Yes that's his real name.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Everything was delicious, and the service was exceptional! There were 3 waiters serving us all of whom were very nice. The food was exceptional we had the following items: BBQ Shrimp appetizer, Caesar Salad - prepared at your table, Seared Tenderloin & Sea Scallops with Bacon Potato, Toasted Walnuts and Blue Cheese and aged Beef Tenderloin. I like the ambiance of the place, classy but not stuffy.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Trying Delmonico was a last minute impromptu decision... My friend and I wanted to grab a quick bite before the rest of our friends arrived. We were underdressed/too casual (shorts/tank tops) to sit in the formal dining area so we just shared a steak at the bar. We started off with drinks which were good and strong. I ordered the Lychee martini which was really good, and I couldnt even taste all the alcohol I watched him pour into. We shared a bone in ribeye, medium rare plus. The steak was really juicy and cooked perfectly, but it lacked flavor... We had to ask for salt and pepper. :(  I don't know if I'd go out of my way to come back... Maybe if I stayed at Venetian and needed another quick bite again.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Whenever I am in Vegas, I want to try Food Network Chef restaurants so for this trip we went and tried Emeril's Delmonico.... and was not blown away. Its either I had high expectations but other than enjoying the bread, their steaks and lobster bisque was little on the salty side (and I enjoy salty). Their salmon with the chorizo hash was pretty acceptable....but they are a steakhouse, so I expected more from their steaks! Not worth the $50 value....Binion's prime rib was way better and more reasonably priced!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I came here with HIGH expectations, and Delmonico's did not disappoint. \n",
      "\n",
      "Each steak ran between $45-55 a la carte, which isn't that extraordinary considering it was a Saturday night in Las Vegas. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had the bone-in rib eye, which was HUGE. Sadly, I couldn't finish it, which is pretty extraordinary for me. We all ordered several sides (potato gratin, asparagus, baked potatoes, etc), each of which cost $9. \n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from the monstrously huge (and tasty!) portions, I think the most memorable feature of Delmonico's was the ambiance and atmosphere. The staff is incredibly helpful, and ensure an enjoyable experience overall. \n",
      "\n",
      "Don't miss out!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] All I can say is yumm! Had reservations through Open Table. Arrived on time & got seated right away. Michael took care of us and was fabulous throughout the evening. We brought our own bottle of Grgich and happily paid the $35 corking fee - bargain. Had tuna tartar, BBQ shrimp, bone in ribeye, lamb chops, creamed corn, truffled chips & bread pudding - all amazing. No complaints whatsoever....deliriously happy. Total bill $235 not including tip - reasonable for locale & quality. Definitely would recommend.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We agree that this was the best filet mignon we ever had. Beautiful crust on the outside and cooked perfectly on the inside. The service was impeccable of course. Side dishes of potatoes and creamed spinach were delicious.  The entire wait staff was very attentive; we never had to get their attention. They seemed to show up at the exact moment we needed them.  Delmonico's will be a must dine on our next trip.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We're locals so our restaurants standards are pretty high. The restaurant was pleasant but nothing exciting in the decor department. Service was good, the menu pedestrian, seafood and steak. The lobster bisque was average, I've had better, but the wilted spinach salad was exceptional. My Chilean sea bass was okay, but again, not fabulous. My husband's rib eye was below average at best, I've cooked better at home. The twice baked potato was ok, but the shell was dry and hard. The dessert special was cheesecake, which was fine, but the banana cream pie was again, nothing to brag about. At this price point, too many other fine choices to bother with this place again.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The lamb is delicious! The atmosphere is wonderful and the service is excellent!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Outstanding service, an intimidating large wine list and great steaks.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Hmm, I thought this place was A-OK. I was surprise to learn its Emeril's restaurant. I mean, I have to say I have tasted better steaks. I got the rib-eye not knowing that it was huge and was really surprise when I saw it. I should have shared and thought the portion was great for 50 bucks. I ordered medium well, but it was redder than normal. I thought it was over seasoned. The potatoes were really good though. The service was okay--we had a big party and they accommodated us, but I felt that since we were a younger crowd than normal, they didn't give the best service they could. The server didn't really smile and forgot one of our checks and so we had to wait for a while to get it backs. \n",
      "The people in my party that didn't get steak enjoyed their dishes. If I go next time, I wouldn't order steak but yet this is a steakhouse..\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] By far the best steak I've ever had. We had a large party of over 20 and they were not the best prepared to handle our group. Once we were settled they were very attentive and timely.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I'd probably give Delmonico four stars, except that my expectations were set higher than they probably should have been. In all honesty, The Delmonico did not deliver anything notably better, more worthy of celebrity, than the average high end steak house in Nashville - including Stoney River, Ruth's, or local favorites like Sperry's. I guess I thought that for all the critique Emeril gives Top Chef stars, his restaurant would blow me away.\n",
      "\n",
      "The homemade truffle chips were good, and somewhat unique, but perhaps a little over cooked, leaving a numb of chips hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our steaks were indeed prepared excellently, and a quality cut of meat. I had the filet, which was an ample serving and cooked to a perfect medium rare.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the twice baked potatoes were a big disappointment. The shells seems to be way overcooked, to the point or requiring a steak knife to cut through them. The flavor was bland, even with cheddar and bacon. A little salt and pepper certainly helped.\n",
      "\n",
      "We did enjoy the creamed spinach, even including my colleague who usually doesn't like green things.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bread pudding was definitely the way to go on dessert. We also had a slice of banana cream pie, but the star was the bread pudding, which was not ruined with raisins. It was rich, smooth, creamy and delicious.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] WOW! Had no idea this place was this good!!! Had some surf and turf and it was excellent! great service and very easy to get to from the Convention Center.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Simply delicious!\n",
      "\n",
      "I went with a group from work while attending a meeting and everyone seemed impressed with the food. We started off with a few appetizers including the calamari which was a little on the salty side, roasted butternut squash ravioli with duck and the crab cakes. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had the spinach and radicchio salad with apple rosemary vinaigrette and warm pistachio crusted goat cheesecake. Yep, that's right, you heard me... a goat cheese cake. It was fantastic. \n",
      "\n",
      "For my entrée I was worried because I had already filled up on the appetizers and my delicious salad but I managed to eat my Filet Mignon medallions with a bacon peppercorn sauce.  We split a few sides as a table including the broccoli, asparagus and some delicious corn dish. I have no idea who ordered it but for the love of all that is holy, you have to get this corn dish. It was phenomenal. The broccoli not so much... too al dente for me!\n",
      "\n",
      "For dessert there were a few orders of the bread pudding and banana cream pie which no one seemed to complain about. The service was a little slow but maybe it was because the place was packed. There was way too much time in between courses. Oh and it took at least 30 minutes to get drinks each round. Maybe go early before the rush hits or just don't go with a party of 13 like we did.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Good but not great for a high end steakhouse.\n",

      "Food = C+\n",
      "Crab cake app was good but not $20 good.  Popup bread very good.  Bone in rib eye was good but not as good as other high end steak houses in the area.  Twice baked potato was excellent.  The Banana Cream Pie looks much better than it actually is (taste like cold banana but nothing else).\n",

My fish was eh, ok, but hey, it's a steakhouse.  What do you expect.  Everyone else raved about their steaks and the appetizers and sides were incredible.  Wine list was amazing and the best was this chocolate something or other desert.  OMG.  I had an orgasm right there at the table, I swear.  Great place, great service. great time.  4 stars.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Such a disappointment!  Here in Vegas with family, we're all a bit of foodies and selected Delmonicos for its reputation as a great steakhouse.  We've dined at other Emeril restaurants and been very pleased, including another Delmonicos location.  The ambiance of the restaurant was considerably lacking.  You expect a steakhouse to have that rich dark woods atmosphere.  This was very bland and nondescript in a city that does things to an excess..  The steak, a bone in ribeye was good but not OMG.  Barbecue shrimp appetizer and popovers were delicious.  Side dishes including the Au gratin potatoes were fair.  Banana cream pie is a must have.  The freezing cold restaurant added to the disappointment.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] One of the best steaks I have ever had.  Everyone at the table thoroughly enjoyed themselves.  This is what life is all about.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] A 5  rating for a 5 restaurant. Located in between the beautiful Palazzo and Venetian Hotel, this restaurant and their staff truly were amazing. From the moment we walked in, every staff member was attentive to our needs. They truly took care of us (party of 7), the waiter was amazing and truly enjoys his job. The food was amazing! Everyone enjoyed their meals and salads/soups. We had a slight small incident with my mom who slipped as we were walking in, and every couple of minutes the manager in charge, Tyler, came and checked on my mom several times. Despite the fall, the restaurant is amazing, we were happy we choose DelMonicos for our dinner!! Keep up the great job!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Huge portions of meat, satisfying sides and about 4 servers who tend to your every need.  Great!\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure the bill was a bit much, but I think that in addition to paying for the Emeril name, you are paying for the stellar service.  Once in a while - this works for me!  A man pushing in my chair, another refilling my water and another taking the cover off my plate - wow.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had an array of dishes:  the bone in steak, pork chops, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach.  The sides look small, but they fill you up and you can share them family style.  Funny, my mom got seared scallops which was a small plate, but they were so delicious!  We had these large plates of meat and we were picking off her dish.  LOL.  Everything was great,  I wasn't expecting something amazing, but we did feel full and like we got a good meal.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The dessert was just okay.  We got the bread pudding and coffee. It is good to go to Vegas and try new places are there are so many quality restaurants.  Def glad I went!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] So this review is going to be two sided since we had mixed experiences. Let me start out by saying this is my 3rd Emeril's restaurant in Vegas. The other two places Fish House and Table 10 are always on the half priced ticket booth so a discount is always possible but given this is a steakhouse in The Venetian no discount. We came here on Dec 30th before our Marroon 5 concert. Securing a reservation over the phone a few days ahead of time was easy. We had wine, appetizers,2 main entrees,2 side dishes and a dessert. \n",
      "The service and customer service here is exceptional. \n",
      "\n",
      "We tried the lobster bisque, pasta special appetizer, BBQ shrimp, Cajun Ribeye, Filet Mignon, Gratin potatoes, Mushrooms and the Choc cake. \n",
      "Most of the food was delicious but a few fell short like the Ribeye and choc cake. the ribeye was overcooked, not that tender and lacking seasoning. The choc cake was dry and previously frozen. The special pasta appetizer was good but not excellent or anything I would mention ordering again. \n",
      "The filet was delicious and the demi glaze sauce was the highlight. The BBQ shimp were delicious along with the little biscuit that comes with it. The lobster bisque was creamy and seasoned well. My server let me try a sample before deciding on a main appetizer. \n",
      "\n",
      "When asked about our dining experience- we were completely honest with the manager and our server. The main issue was how long we waited for our meal and the $55 ribeye didn't live up to his name. They also forgot to put in one of our appetizers. However, this place gets a four instead of a three because of the amazing customer service we received as a guest. They expedited our food and when we received the bill the ribeye, 2 appetizers, and the cake was taken off our entire bill which to me speaks volumes about how great their customer relations and service is. They have a name to live up to . We had a mixed dining experience but I would probably come back and give this place another chance due to the outstanding customer service. Keep up the good work.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] So Mr Food Network himself Emeril has his own steak house. \n",
      "One thing I know - is my steaks. Mmmmm Dry aged bone in rib eye....here just waiting to enter my watering mouth and be consumed by my emotional grinding of my mandibles.\n",
      "How can I forget - Truffle oil potato chips.  Popping my truffle oil cherry....Yum\n",
      "Ok I've never had fancy schmancy gumbo. But here it was very pleasant and chic. I mean come on - GUMBO - I WANT PIECES OF MEAT AND SEAFOOD AND OKRA.....\n",
      "Bone in RIB EYE - no more done than medium rare. Doesn't need any extra spices or sauces give me my meat plain. If I wanted it coated with jism. Well I can do it myself :)\n",
      "Steamed or grilled asparagus with hollandaise...Mmmmm\n",
      "I ate a lot...So I didn't have dessert like everyone else did. If I could I would have sucked on the bones. But that would have been a culinary faux paus. Bad Myke No sucking.....So How do they make the thick steak so dark and perfectly medium rare? Hmm...It's gotta be Keebler Elves performing magic.\n",
      "The service is impeccable. I went to the bathroom and put my napkin on my chair - just to find it folded neatly on my table.  Can we say Fancy Feast?\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I really can't eat steak anywhere else in Vegas if I have the opportunity of getting a reservation here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bone-in rib eye, creamed spinach.  Delicious.  No complaints!!!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] As Vegas steakhouses go, Delmonico is a fine choice. I've been there twice and both times I've had very good meals. With that said, meeting expectations at this high price point is challenging, and particularly on my most recent visit I'm afraid Delmonico should have been even better. This year we had a large company dinner at Delmonico, so I was able to try lots of dishes. \n",
      "\n",
      "We started with the BBQ shrimp and the butternut squash ravioli. The shrimp was good but a little overcooked. The squash was on the rich side but really tasty - you couldn't have but so many so it is good that they list it as an appetizer rather than as a pasta main. I loved one or two but a plateful would've been too much.  I also tried the truffle potato chips, which were wonderful but extremely truffley. \n",
      "\n",
      "The lobster bisque was textbook, exactly what lobster bisque is supposed to be - rich and creamy with chunks of tender lobster meat. Still I might have preferred my neighbor's heirloom tomato salad, which I tried and thought was one of the highlights of the meal.  I didn't try it but the duck from the smoked duck salad was not well received by another of my colleagues. \n",
      "\n",
      "For my entrée I had the Delmonico signature steak - a bone-in ribeye. This is where the meal fell down ever so slightly. The steak was fine but for the premium price it should have been exceptional and it definitely wasn't. My order of medium rare was barely pink at all and was probably served on the dark side of medium, and I thought the meat was surprisingly devoid of flavor. Don't get me wrong - it was a fine steak, but it was average among the steaks I've had in Las Vegas, at all price points. One of my close work friends who has frequented Delmonico for years ordered the same cut at the dinner and he agreed that for his steak too it was an off-night. Of the sides I loved the creamed corn. Next time I'd do the mashed potatoes over the scalloped potatoes, which I found undercooked and under seasoned. The asparagus was also fine but unspectacular. \n",
      "\n",
      "The bread pudding was great and the key lime pie (or was it cheesecake?) was nice too, but I'll reserve my sweetest accolades for the banana cream pie. Best bite of the night. One of the best I've had. Wonderful.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Food: Disappointing\n",
      "\n",
      "Service: Excellent\n",
      "\n",
      "10 of us dined, expecting a Vegas Fine Dining experience with memorable foods. It was truly disappointing. The service was spot on, but the food was BLAH. The only Seafood options were Salmon, or Oysters on a half shell. They were cold. \n",
      "\n",
      "The veggies were decent, but everyone was unimpressed.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] 4 words: BIG FAT BUTTERY STEAK.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't waste your money at Carnevino. Come here instead :)\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Went here with some friends while my husband and I were having our couple's shower in Vegas prior to our wedding. His best man raved about the restaurant, so we decided to give it a go.\n",
      "\n",
      "We made a reservation for the first seating, but they weren't quite ready for us when we got there, so we sat in the bar area and ordered a couple of drinks. I got a very good pino noir, though I can't recall where it was from.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was time to be seated, we were escorted to our table through a line of wait staff. Honestly, it was a bit uncomfortable walking through all those people. Once we got to our table, our server came over and gave us menus. Both the server and her assistant were pleasant enough, though I don't know I would go as far as saying there were \"friendly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We all ordered our starters and make courses, plus a couple of sides. I got the lobster bisque, which I wasn't all that impressed with. I had better lobster bisque on cruise ship. It was a bit salty and the way they presented it was a bit tacky, in my opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the entrees came, everything was fine. The steak was good, but I don't know that I would ever pay $50+ for it again. I asked for medium, and I got medium rare. Which was fine for me, but one of my friends had the same problem, and it kinda grossed her out. So she had to send it back. The server got the problem fixed very quickly, and it was perfect the second time around.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did like that they came with some sauces. The Bearnaise was very good and my husband devoured the peppercorn sauces. The sides were all good, but not as big as we had anticipated. Our waiter said they should feed 3-4 people. However, when you have two 250+ pound guys with you, it was not enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "The desserts were FANTASTIC. I had the creme brule, which was perfect. Soft and creamy, with a yummy hard shell on the top. I would order that again in a heart beat. And we all felt the deserts were very reasonably priced for what we received. Definitely big enough for 2 people to share.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, 3 starts. Everything was good and probably would have gotten 4 stars, if not for the price of everything. When you pay that much for food, you expect to be wowed. And we just weren't. But no major complaints either.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Absolutely impressed with this restaurant. The entire dining experience was amazing. My favorite had to be their pork belly. It was meat candy. I could've ordered 2 or 3 and been happy with that for the entire night.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Excellent experience overall and best steakhouse in Vegas. I'd say it is the best restaurant I've ever been to and we have been to many fine dining restaurants. This was the second time we've dined here and both times rate the highest score I can give. Our server, Frank, and his crew were fantastic! The apps were great, bbq shrimp and bone in bacon. Salads were just alright but main courses and dessert was great. Filet and bone in ribeye were what most of our 7 top ordered, all cooked and Creole seasoned to perfection. Sides are shareable and the cream corn was the best. If you get dessert, you must go with the banana cream pie! We'll definitely be attending again.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Let's be honest: steakhouses are a dime-a-dozen in Las Vegas. Every which way you look, there's some place that's being advertised as \"The Best Steakhouse in Nevada!\" or \"THE Las Vegas Steakhouse\" or \"If Elvis Were Alive, He Would Eat Here!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Not all steakhouses are created equal -- Delmonico is proof of that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Situated in between the Palazzo and the Venetian, Delmonico is unassuming from the outside. It looks simple and classy. Once you step inside, however, you realize that comfort is their highest priority. The chairs are deep and made of the most comfortable leather. You won't want to get up when you're finished with your meal. \n",
      "\n",
      "This was our second visit (our first for lunch), and I must say that the service was just as attentive and cordial as they had been the first time. Both of our servers were named Peter (which turned out to be quite humorous when we called out for one and they both came running), and they were extremely pleasant. They had absolutely no problem recommending dishes or letting us know their personal favorites. \n",
      "\n",
      "For my appetizer, I had the heirloom tomato salad. The tomatoes were ripe, juicy, and delicious. The accompanying cheese was a perfect pair to offset the acidity of the tomatoes. Thin slivers of onions covered the perimeter of the plate, which were also very nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "I chose the fillet of beef medallions for my entree, and I was impressed with how absolutely wonderful they were. About a half-dollar in diameter and an inch tall, they were perfectly cooked, not to mention topped in Parmesan cheese and drizzled with homemade Worcestershire sauce. \n",
      "\n",
      "Delmonico doesn't need to be one of those places that wears people out with advertising. They know how good they are, and they aren't afraid to knock your socks off. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a relaxing way to enjoy an evening with good people and great food.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I am of cajun decent and HAD to try Emeril's gumbo.  It wasn't \"mom's\", but it was excellent gumbo for Las Vegas.  It was a darker roux and rich.\n",
      "Everyone had steaks which were perfectly cooked and had an amazing, salty, flavorful seasoning.  The Lobster Bisque was one of the top bisque's we've ever tried!\n",
      "Also had to try banana's foster which we highly recommend!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This is probably one of my favorite places for steak, bread pudding, or when I wanna eat at the bar alone. Here is a summary of one of my experiences that I shared with one of my foodie friends when we ate here. \n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered the Caesar Salad which was spectacularly prepared fresh able side by the maitre 'd. It was like $30 but probably THE best salad of my life! Next was the bone in rib eye which was so perfectly seasoned and cooked! I'm a huge fan of sides so I got the creamed spinach, a Idaho baked potato, creamed corn, and asparagus. YES, there were amazing left overs!\n",
      "\n",
      "For dessert of course it was the White Chocolate Macadamia nut Bread Pudding! If anyone knows Emril's shows or books you know this is like his signature item. I have also had the Duck Egg Creme Brulee which is heavenly as well. But my go to is the bread pudding!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a place you probably wouldn't wanna eat at daily, but it is a place to take special friends who enjoy good food at it's best or for an awesome night of self spoiling! :)\n",
      "\n",
      "*Lobster bique, the butternut squash ravioli and the fried chicken are killer too!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We had planned this Valentine's Dinner/birthday dinner for over a week and were really looking forward to it. Service was superb, venue/ambiance was lovely. We ordered a sea scallop, mushroom and black truffle sauce appetizer- it was tasty. We both had the lobster bisque, nothing special, but very good, and presentation was nice. My husband ordered the double-cut pork chop, the size of a dinosaur. It was supposed to be medium, but was charred and a bit over done. I ordered the sea bass, but asked the chef to prepare it like the snapper special. It was thin, overly salted, and overall just not good. I am not a fan of al dente rice. I'm sure the chef prepares entrees a certain way for a reason, this just missed the mark in so many ways for me, when I had such high expectations. The head server promptly replaced my meal with a medium rare filet, in about 60 seconds. The steak looked dry, besides the pat of butter atop, the plate was hot, making me think it had been under the food warmer for some time. There was a crusted char on the exterior and Cajun seasoning, which again in my opinion was too much, and too salty. I want to taste the steak at a steakhouse, not cover it. Of all of the options in Vegas, we could get a lot better tasting food with equivalent price and service elsewhere. We will not be returning.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] As a restaurant under Emeril Lagasse's name, I was expecting a consistent, quality meal.  Instead, I left very disapointed with the restaurant.  The only highlight was the signature BBQ shrimp appetizer.  The butternut squash raviolis with duck confit were unexplainably dry.  The shredded duck on top should be slightly dry or crispy, but the inside of the raviolis shouldn't be.  I don't know if I could even say the butternut squash was pasty.  So dry it was bordering on gritty.   \n",
      "\n",
      "The truffle parmesan potato chips were cut ultra thin and so tasty, but were dripping with too much oil.  Instead of tasting light and airy, they felt weighed down by goopy oil drops that clung to each chip.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's the steak.  We ordered one bone in ribeye and a standard ribeye.  Both cuts were juicy, marbled nicely and cooked to the right levels, except for one thing, the steak had no taste.  What creates the taste, seasoning and aging?  Well, whatever it was, it was only surface deep.  the outer portion of the steak was seasoned, but the meat in the middle really had no taste.  Even the butter scoop that topped the steak couldn't make a noticeable difference.    \n",
      "\n",
      "Don't get me wrong, the meat quality was good, but if I pay $50 for a steak, I expect flavor.  It felt like I was eating a $25 steak.   I almost wanted to ask them for bernaise sauce to get me through it.  Even though the wait staff was extremely helpful and attentive, it couldn't save this disappointing meal.   \n",
      "\n",
      "In Vegas the only other steakhouse I've been to is N9ne at the Palms and I would recommend that over Delmonico's in a heartbeat.   I don't think I'll be going back.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This is a good steak place but not like the best steak ever, it's owned by Emeril, so most of the dishes has this unique Creole / Louisianna taste...If your staying at the Venetian this is a good place to get your steak fix =)...\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I had the privilege of coming here in honor of two fo my friends' birthdays last month. Being the type of guy who rarely eats at anywhere higher than a two $ sign establishment, I'd have to say this is by far the best dining experience I've ever had in my life, so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our night started off with a VERY informative waiter showing us the ropes. It makes sense why these servers make the money they make, they are extremely good at their job and know the menu and wine pairings like the back of their hand. ..at least the server we had was of this caliber.\n",
      "\n",
      "For starters, we had the Truffle Parmesean potato chips. These things are incredible. It's one of those dishes where you just want to savor each bite one chip at a time. SO GOOD.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also tried the Lobster Bisque. Best Lobster Bisque I've ever had. Very smooth, rich in lobster flavor, and not too overly salty. Some fresh cracked pepper makes it just absolutely perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "My two friends went for the chateaubriand. An exquisite cut of tenderloin(same cut as filet mignon) SO tender that it just nearly melts in your mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the Bone in Rib-eye. Quite possibly the best steak I've ever had in my life. I ordered it medium rare. It was cooked perfectly, and once I had a taste, I just had to close my eyes and shut down all my other senses so that I can thorougly enjoy this. It was quite a big steak, but with the price I paid and the epic state of mind I was in, I finished it knowing that I couldn't leave all that buttery meaty goodness behind unfinished.\n",
      "\n",
      "That on top of a bottle of wine and a few sides, our meal came out to be.. well.. expensive. But SO WORTH IT.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Second time dining at DelMonico.  Food was great service was on\n",
      "Point. A must when in Las Vegas\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I have had steaks @ many great steakhouses the bone in rib eye is by far the best I've ever had. My wife ordered the salmon and it was excellent. We ordered corn and fingerling potatoes as sides. Both were good but wish I would have gotten something other than the fingerling potatoes. Overall great service, amazing steak & salmon highly recommend!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] A bit torn about this place...\n",
      "\n",
      "I heard through the grape vine that Delmonico Steakhouse was the best steakhouse in Las Vegas. Having heard that, I made reservations for Delmonico 2 whopping months prior to my boyfriend's birthday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evening finally arrived when we were going to dine at this fabulous establishment. Upon entering the host was a bit busy fiddling with something to greet me immediately. When he did, he told us to have a seat in the lounge and that our table would be ready shortly. After 2 minutes, our hostess showed us to our table and even laid the napkin in our laps. It didn't take long for us to order so I got the filet mignon and a side of potatoes gratin, while my boyfriend had the ribeye and the jumbo crab.\n",
      "\n",
      "Initially the filet mignon was quite delicious, very juicy and delicious. Getting near the end of my filet, however, it started getting dry, and I tasted the herbs and spices grinding against my tongue. The potatoes gratin were good but a little dry, I would have liked it to be a little more moist. I tried a piece of my boyfriend's ribeye and it was nice and tender, and the jumbo crab did not disappoint.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our server(s) were nice, however I felt a bit rushed during the meal. He did one hell of a job taking our pictures tho! Overall, Delmonico's would be a 3.5\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] What an amazing place to eat. I had the New York strip with rosemary & garlic cloves. Medium rare was cooked to perfection as well. Absolutely delicious. I had two dirty martinis, which were mixed to perfection. Also they included 3 olives (odd numbers only acceptable in mixed drinks) without me having to ask for an odd number. I don't get picky when bar tenders don't know this about mixed drinks, but I sure do appreciate it when bar tenders do! \n",
      "Their bread is light and lovely as well, which should be noted because you won't get full when treating yourself to some pre-entree goodness. \n",
      "I ordered their twice baked potato which was creamy and delicious beyond belief. I also tried their creamy spinach which was a lovely touch to my meal. \n",
      "For dessert, I asked the server to suggest a dessert liquor and she brought me Licor 43. Highly recommend this booze too, but I appreciate the server knowing what to suggest. I also ordered their coconut ice cream for dessert, which was obviously as delicious as the rest of my meal. The best part is, the ice cream wasn't sugary. It just tasted like the flavor I ordered, without it feeling like there was sugar paste residue after eating it. An amazing place, with amazing servers and better food. Cheers!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Located in the restaurant/shopping area between the Venetian and Palazzo, this is a great steak place.  Went with a group of friends and we all had 1 thing on our mind.  Steak.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We didn't order any alcohol since we were kind of recovering a bit from the night before.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For appetizers, I had the tuna and salmon tartare which was good.  Bunch of my friends had lobster bisque which was rich but very good as well.  The rolls came with a small amount of butter on them and would taste great in the bisque, I'm sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "For steaks, everyone went with either the New York or Filet.  I had the filet topped with seared foie gras.  The combination of the two was excellent and very flavorful.  I sadly had to leave some foie gras left over because it was too much.  I tried the New York and that was great as well.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For sides we had the potatoes au gratin asparagus.  I didn't have any of the sides, but everyone seemed pretty pleased with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, no dessert really jumped out at me.  Everyone split the banana cream pie, but I passed on that since I'm not a fan of bananas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service was great.  It was pretty loud though, so I couldn't really hear 2 of my friends who were across the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall though, excellent meal.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I was able to sample many menu items on my first and only visit to Delmonico's to date.   The things I loved were the Parmesan chip appetizer, the caesar salad, the soft shell crab and the BBQ shrimp app.  The Caesar salad was probably the best I've ever had.  The chips were thin cut and perfectly crispy.  The BBQ shrimps were cooked just right and the bbq sauce was mild and great for the shrimp.  The crab was excellent - perfectly cooked and had great flavor. I also tried the NY strip, it was cooked correctly and had a nice crust.  It was not the best steak I've ever had, but you can tell it was done with care and quality.  The appetizers were very good because each one had something that made it special...I would like to see that with the steaks as well.  I would say the service is what i was most disappointed in.  Not that it was bad, but it just wasn't what you expect from a place of this caliber (and price).\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I would rank this as the #2 ribeye I have ever had so far. My number 1 is Manny's in Minneapolis,but this gave it a run for its money. I ordered the boneless ribeye medium well Oscar style and it was absolutely perfect.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Good food.  Horrible service.  Had dinner in early March with a friend and the service was horrendous.  No one took are drink order for over 15 minutes even though the restaurant was only half full on a Thursday night - many people who were seated after us were already having their second drink and getting their appetizers.  Eventually after trying to get the waiters attention as he repeatedly walked by I ended up just having to get up and walk across the restaurant to have some one take our order which led to a waiter taking our drink and food order in a couple minutes....  But even then the service was lackluster and not a bit apologetic about the wait.  If you are spending $300 for dinner for two you expect decent service.  This place was a big fail.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This is what a steakhouse ought to be. Located in the Venetian/Palazzo complex, it's divided into several rooms, all pleasantly decorated. The ambience is relaxed and friendly. The wait staff is attentive without being overbearing. There's none of the pretense you get at, say Carnevino in the same hotel complex. There is a nice energy level but you can easily hear each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "We brought a wine bottle from home and the wait staff was fine with it. They politely informed us of the corkage fee (a reasonable $30) without making us feel weird about having brought our own bottle the way some places do.\n",
      "\n",
      "We started with a very tasty shrimp cocktail to share. Then I moved on to the Piedmontese boneless strip steak, which was delicious. Helen had the salmon, which was like butter. Potatoes au gratin made a nice side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything was perfectly cooked, impeccable in quality, and served with refined flair.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Had solo lunch at a table. The service here is some of the best I've ever encountered, hands down. Lunch may be a little more casual than dinner but there was no evidence of it in the level of professionalism. As time permitted, the staff really appreciated chatting about food and restaurants.\n",

      "I enjoyed the rich, super savory lobster bisque immensely. A meal in itself. The cajun salmon - featuring a nice salmon filet, french fried onions, and andouille hash - was prettty delicious. The best thing in this dish was the perfectly-cooked and seasoned salmon. While important to the overall combination, the cajun sauce was a little too gelatinous and as a result its sweetness was more cloying in my opinion. I thought had it been thinner it would have blended in more without overpowering with its texture. Overall the dish was very tasty.\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My wife and I were very excited to visit the restaurant, however, although the service was superb, the overall taste and quality of the meal was lacking and something to be desired. The \"feel\" and atmosphere of the restaurant was dull and drab, with chairs lining the walls towards the restaurant which seems to be very far away from the main dining area, loud noises from kids with no supervision and an atmosphere that  just wasn't romantic and inviting. If I had to do it again I would go somewhere else,  as there are many other restaurants on The Strip where you can spend in excess of  $150 and get more value. The most impressive part of the meal was the attentive wait staff, they were extremely professional, courteous and attended to our every need.\n",

They recommended dishes for us based on our likes. It really felt like they were committed to ensuring we were well cared for during our entire time. When we ordered coffee one of our friends went to the restroom. We were all enjoying our coffee when she returned. No sooner had she sat down one of the servers filled her cup so it would be nice and hot. It's those special touches that make this place so special. Now for the food. Delicious! The bone in ribeye is amazing and the salmon is delightful. The sides are served family style and honestly you cannot go wrong with any of them. We loved the corn dish was our favorite. We cannot thank the staff enough for such a wonderful dining experience.\n",

First,we had a 5:00 reservation and there right when they opened. We had stated on our reservations that it was was our anniversary. We got no acknowledgement of it and were seated at the worst table in the restaurant in a corner with a cheap floor lamp that was covered in dust next to us. No one was even in the restaurant, so they could have given us a nice booth. It was still dead there at 6:30 when we left. On to the food. Popovers were just ok. Hubby's ribeye was yummy. My filet however, was dry as the Sahara and had no flavor. Not a speck of juice ran out when I cut into it. My hubby said it looked like jerky. So disappointed. Sides creamed spinach and twice baked potato were just ok. Twice baked was just a big greasy glob of cheese and wasn't even hot. For dessert, we got the banana cream pie. It was good but I was expecting it to wow me based on what others had said about it. Sadly, I don't think I'll be back. For the price, I'd rather have Mastros or Ruth's Chris.\n",

The entire dish had zero flavor until I added salt and pepper (I NEVER salt my food after cooking). The sides we had were good- wild mushrooms and creamed spinach. Our husbands steaks were good but nothing to write home about. Servers were attentive but they get a big zero for 1 reason- we told them our fish was dry in a very nice/hushed manor and they still charged us for it.

I forget what she had as an entree.  The French onion soup was gross, it tasted like dish water.  So we asked the waiter to bring us the Lobster Bisque instead.  It took us too long to find our server though.  To their credit, they took the french onion off of our tab.  The lobster Bisque was not special, very bland even for lobster bisque.  The shrimp came out very poor, the bbq sauce tasted burnt and the shrimp were small.  And to top the night off, my steak was medium well almost well done, when I had asked for medium rare.\n",

We also shared the cream corn and garlic smashed potatoes. Our food was served quickly and the red wines we ordered were fantastic - the Tobin James was darker than I usually like it but rich and paired very well with the ribeye. My Meiomi was a bit lighter and fruitier but was a great recommendation for its price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be prepared for a BIG meal, the slabs of meat are huge and we barely got through half of our sides. So come hungry! Both the porkchop and ribeye were delicious - flavorful, tender, and juicy. Several waiters came by to check on us which was appreciated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only reason I'm docking a star is for the decor - a bit plain and out of the 90s. Lighting is perfectly dim but hopefully they renovate to match the prices. To be clear though, this is not a reason to not come - the dinner will be worth it!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I go to this restaurant every time I go to Vegas, which in my line of work is about 4 times a year. The food and service can't be beat. Now, in a fairness it is one of those she she places where everything is rediculously over priced and gives you that feeling of \"do i make enough money to eat here\" lol Its all an act and at the end of the day, it really is a fantastic place to eat!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] OMG !!!!!!!!!!!!! Hands down the best dinning experience I've ever had had the bone in rib eye was absolutely to die for. Enjoyed the 5 cheese platter several drinks and the strawberry sorbet all were of the finest quality. My girlfriend had the salmon which was also cooked to perfection we both enjoyed the twice baked potato for our sides  which was the best I've ever had. Food, service, and attention to detail were absolutely the best\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My family and business associates have visited Delmonico over the past eight years and in the past were delighted with the food (although we did notice some service slippage over the last couple years). However, the last visit in 2010 was a big disappointment. The food was just average and the service was terrible. My steak came to the table sans the melted butter and the server's solution was to bring a pat of butter several minutes later. There are too many outstanding restaurants for us to ever visit this restaurant again.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My buddy booked this place for my bachelor party dinner. We had a group of 10 but the restaurant can only seat parties of 9 at most together at one table.  Since we had 10, they had to put us on two separate tables, which was ok, because they were right next to each other anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Decor:  nothing spectacular.  i thought it was alittle too dim for me.  I like a well lit restaurant for the purpose of really getting to see the different colors of your food and wine.  You can tell a lot about your food by it's color...it's freshness, it's doneness, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food:  Very good.  I had the filet and it was super tender.  My buddies ordered the bone in rib-eye and almost all said it was amongst the best steaks they ever had.  Everything is a la carte so we shared sides of grilled asparagus (good), garlic smashed potatoes (yummy), sauteed wild mushrooms (yummy), and caesar salad (good).\n",
      "\n",
      "Service:  Very good also.  Our waiter was very polite even when our rowdy half drunk group couldn't decide on what to order.  He was very helpful with the wine and picked out a nice bottle of merlot that worked with our budget.  Server's were very fast and attentive.  They made sure everything was perfect...which pretty much was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Price:  Pretty fair and expected of a high end steak house.  bone in 20 oz. rib-eye was about $50 and my 12 oz. filet was around $45.  Sides were around $8-12, and one order feeds 2 people.  Yes, they have an extensive wine list and Yes, they have seafood also.\n",
      "\n",
      "One last important note:  there isn't a smoking/non-smoking section, so people with kids, and non-smokers beware.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I came here with some girlfriends during my Bachelorette weekend in Vegas. We had a reservation for 7 girls, and were very promptly sat at our reservation hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service here is spectacular, and the food is equally enjoyable. My girls and I shared our entrees and side dishes, so that we could each have a taste of a little bit of everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Entrees:\n",
      "- FILET MIGNON - 9 oz, and absolutely melt-in-your-mouth yummy. This cut was like BUTTER.\n",
      "- EMERIL'S BBQ SALMON - Also melted like butter with every bite. It was amazing how tender, yet well-cooked the fish was. The hash side dish that came with the meal was very complimentary!\n",
      "- GRILLED MARINATED ORGANIC CHICKEN BREAST - Mostly juicy (a teeny bit dry), but great flavors. The fingerling potatoes were pretty standard, and the wild mushrooms weren't very tasty to me.\n",
      "- BONE IN RIBEYE - 20 oz, and great for sharing! Our waiter even cut the steak for our girls so that each could have medium rare/well.\n",
      "- AMERICAN RED SNAPPER - the sides didn't seem as appealing at first for my friend who had this dish, but she ended up enjoying them!\n",
      "\n",
      "Sides:\n",
      "- CREAMED CORN GRATINÉE - delicious. A great combination of that sweet and salty flavor. Texture was right on point!\n",
      "- BUTTERED FRESH ASPARAGUS - fabulous crunch, and not so much flavor added to cover up the natural enjoyable flavor of the veggie\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, a great experience. We weren't too full at the end of the meal, and didn't have to worry about wasting any food or taking back any leftovers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Highly recommended!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We had a great experience at Delmonico.  Great food, wine and service made for a great meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "We started with bbq shrimp and ahi tartare.  The bbq shrimp is New Orleans style which is shrimp in gravy rather than a typical bbq and it was very tasty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gumbo was good and had a bit of heat, great stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "My bone-in ribeye was cooked to medium and had a creole rub that was delicious.\n",

      "The service was prompt, attentive and courteous.\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We wanted to catch a little Sunday Football while enjoying some great food. Our original plan was to spend Football Sunday at Lagasse's Stadium. But, we were greeted by a line of about 15 people waiting to get in.  Not too bad. But in the 20 mins we were there, the line never moved. \"Sports Bar\" or not, I should have known if it bears Emeril's name then a reservation should be made. So off we went to find a spot for football Sunday and came upon a sign at Delmonico announcing Sunday Football specials in the bar.  The bar was loaded with every liquor bottle imaginable and the menu... We'll it's Emeril Lagasse so enough said. We took a seat and ordered what turned out to be the best meal of our trip! My boyfriend and I ordered up a couple of cold beers, Truffled Parmesan Chips and Lobster Sliders to share. OH EM GEE!!  The Sliders were amazing! Nicely toasted roll filled with a creamy, perfectly seasoned lobster salad. No skimping on the lobster either. Nice, tender chunks and crisp pieces of celery for added crunch. Delish! The chips... We'll, we ordered another batch.. They were THAT good!  Crisp, crunchy, chips drizzled with truffle oil for that earthy yumminess and sprinkled with some tangy grated Parmesan. At halftime, we followed up with the Grilled Ricotta and Tomato Soup. Fantastic! Thick layer of creamy Ricotta and Basil between slices of buttered grilled toast. Not sure if the soup was intended for dipping but that's what we did! The soup was light and tangy -perfect for taking our ricotta sandwich for a dip!!  Meal was amazing & staff was friendly ( Michelle was super attentive). This isn't your Carlos and Charlie's or Senior Frogs so don't let the \"football specials\" fool you. You get what you pay for and you will definitely pay for what you get here! And it's worth it!!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Long overdue review! Went back in July...and swore to myself I needed to give the place kudos because we had such a lovely experience. The food was delicious...and yes, it's a steakhouse, but I'd go back just for the banana cream pie. Oh...how I long for that pie. Anyway...the standout though has got to be the service. When our steaks came, I was disappointed to see that my steak had been overcooked - but it was clearly a busy night (and it looked like they had some crazy difficult customers that night), and I'm not usually one to complain, so I figured it still tasted good, and said nothing. But the manager, Ken, was nearby, and must've seen me sort of picking and inspecting my food, and he came by to make sure things were okay. I said they were fine, but he insisted on checking it out for me -- and in the end, even though I had already taken a few bites, he brought me a whole new steak and made sure it was cooked the way I liked before he left us to dine. That is fantastic service. \n",
      "\n",
      "Food was delicious, foie gras was heavenly (damn you California for banning it!), and the service top notch.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Best filet mignon of my life...cooked to perfection with cajun spices. The wine list blew my socks off...and I am a viticulture/enology geek (in normal English...I am a wine snob). This, was in fact, the most impressive part of my meal here. I couldn't stop turning the pages of the wine list (evidently the largest wine list on the West Coast). The sides are unbelievable and complementary to the steak. I highly recommend the carrot cake for dessert. Emeril sure outdid himself here.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This restaurant is amazing! We started with the BBQ Shrimp & Oysters. Then my husband got the Shrimp & Grits. \n",
      "\n",
      "But what satisfied me (and had flavors that I will continue to search for) was the Pappardelle Pasta with Wild Mushrooms. It had (and I quote from the menu) Fresh White Italian Truffles, Parmesan Reggiano, Vermont Butter and Local Chives. I can't wait to come back just to get this, but it was a special, so hopefully they will have it!\n",
      "\n",
      "The staff was great too. Very helpful and not stuffy at all. I told our waiter I was craving pasta (which is limited on their menu) and he said they could make me a shrimp scampi on the fly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I thought their digital wine list was so cool!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Wow! New favorite spot in Vegas. The Bone-in Ribeye is a lot of steak for the money, we'll marbled, and cooked to a perfect \"rare-medium-rare.\" It was so damn good, but I had to cut and give away slivers around the table. I could've easily split that plate with a salad and the fried oyster app (which was eerily reminiscent of Commanders Palace in N.O.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a bite of the salmon with that sweet chili BBQ sauce which was buttery soft and very tasty. It was a nice contrast to the Fred Flintstone size steak. I also tried some of the grilled cheese dipped into the Tomato Bisque. Whoa, what a rush of flavors. The cream spinach was really good. More texture from the spinach than usual with the perfect balance of cream. Asparagus had just the right texture too. How will I eat dessert?\n",
      "\n",
      "Banana Cream Pie, that's how. IT'S DIVINE! You must try it. Polly and Marie be damned. This tall towering pie can be shared 3 or 4 ways, but you must go vertical. Cut a slab, drag it through the caramel sauce, slather it with cream, and throw it on your plate. Don't leave here without a cross-section of all its layered goodness. Look how happy my friend Lauren P. from San Diego was when it came.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming back fo sho. Emeril, you kick ass. BAM!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Wow, what can I say that hasn't been mentioned here yet.  The food was good the service was great.  We were pushing the service a little so we could get to Rock of Ages in time so we couldn't enjoy the ambiance as much as we liked.  This is one of the top 3 steakhouses in Las Vegas in my book.  JW and Craft are the other 2 on the list.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Came here for a celebration, the only reason I chose this place was because I am a HUGE fan of banana cream pie, and all the reviews on here were raving about it. So I figured why not?! \n",
      "\n",
      "Right away, you realize that this place is trying to be something special. I say trying because it doesn't quite get it right. You do have 2 servers, and they pay attention to every little detail, which is great. I mean I was only thinking that i needed another iced tea, and before I could signal for one, the server had one ready for me. Great!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I got the feeling everyone was trying a little to hard, I could tell only because everyone was so nervous and stumbling either over their words or the presentation of the food. \n",
      "\n",
      "Food wise, the food was GREAT! The steak was literally falling apart, I didn't even have to use any force at all to cut my filet. It was like thick beef jerky, if you can imagine that!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Highly Recommended!!!!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Had been here four years ago and the experience was so much better that time. We brought a fine bordeaux for my birthday both times and were aware of the corkage policy. Wine spectator gives them the highest award and complements their corkage policy in fact. It took forever to get the bottle decanted and it really wasn't optimal and the meal was rushed. We even had cocktails  Snotty server, devil may care attitude. Sommelier? Or was he just the one who poured wine?  Not sure as he also offered food recommendations. Gumbo good, tomato soup and grill cheese ap okay but not fine. Avg cream spinach and dried baked potato. Partner had BBQ shrimp and was not overly impressed. Sadly the rib eye was only decent, but not out of this world. I was so looking forward to this night and it was a disappointment. Cavernous restaurant about 70 % filled on a Wednesday but the personal touch and care of a few years ago was gone.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Family and I went last night.  Everything was mediocre except my wife's filet.  Prices are crazy\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Under delivered on the steak.  Had the bone in New York charred medium rare and it was over - cooked, a bit dry and chewy on the edges.  The other 3 patrons at my table enjoyed their steaks.  The creamed corn was very good.  Service was top notch.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Really good steakhouse! We went there for our friend's birthday. The environment is nice but maybe a tiny bit noisier as I expected. My boyfriend and I ordered a Lobster Bisque to share, which was good but not especially exciting. He ordered a Filet Mignon, I believe, and was fantastic! It literally melted in my mouth and we were able to cut it with a butter knife.. so tender! I ordered a season entree - Grilled halibut on a bed of lumbcrab meat w/ some kind of aioli. It was alright... the crab was tasty but the fish was a bit dry... \n",
      "\n",
      "Our friend ordered the Tournedos au Poivre and his girlfriend ordered the Ribeye. The Ribeye was huge for the price! We also ordered a couple of sides to share - New Orleans Creamed Spinach, Sauteed Garlic Mushrooms and Truffle Parmesan Potato Chips. I have to say the mushrooms was really good! Didn't really care for the creamed spinach because it was too heavy for me. The chips was good, too, but I wanted to compare it to Alexander's Truffle oil fries... That's one of my future plans =P\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I think the steaks are worth the price. Other stuff are good but not extremely exciting.... I guess you should always go for the steaks at a steakhouse!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I stumbled into Delmonico Steakhouse after going to the wrong place as suggested by my friend. He told me to go to Emeril's in Vegas, so I did. However, the only place that houses Emeril's name is the Fish House.\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend challenged me that Demonico had the best Caesar salad after I claimed I had found the holy grail. So I had to try it here. First off, they make it from scratch, tableside here. They even have you inspect it before putting salad in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previously I thought I had good Caesar salad, but this was on a different level. The salads that I've had before were either good or bad. The flavor was just that. however this salad actually had *waves* of flavor. you could distinctly taste the pepper fade in and out, the egg fade in and out, sardines fade in and out, and other flavors until it mellowed out on your palette. WTF, are you serious? I didn't even know salad dressing could do that. I give the salad a 5/5\n",
      "\n",
      "My lady and I shared the lamb. I am not a huge lamb eater because I generally find it too fatty and I don't like fatty texture. This was good though and I did enjoy it all. It could have been a little more charred on the outside as I found that part to be the most tasty. I probably would have been better off with something a little more traditional like steak, I suppose. I'll give them lamb a 4/5\n",
      "\n",
      "For dessert I got this cheesecake that was akin to a smore. It was seriously yum. I was stuffed before I started it, and I still ate it - it was that good. I will give it a 5/5.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was magnificent with this place was the service. I am very particular with service and how often the service visits your table. I was a little scared at first of this place when they announced that we would be attended by three different people. Of crap I thought, they are going to be down my throat every bite. But really, they worked it like a charm. They came when they needed to and didn't come when they didn't need to come - all three of them. My water was constantly full as well. I really appreciated this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to go back here next time I am in town and do a few things differently. First, don't eat 3 hours before arriving. I was not all that hungry when I arrived and I felt like I was doing myself a disservice. Second, try something more to my liking such as chicken or steak. I have to give it a 4.5 but yelp doesn't allow a half mark. I feel that the main part of the meal was the weakest which is the main reason you are there so I am rounding down to 4-stars. Maybe if I enjoyed the main course a little more (not that it was bad) then I would have given it a straight 5-stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll be back.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My rating is based solely on my experiences at the bar and Max Solano's mastery of spirits. I kind of treat Vegas like a giant tapas restaurant and basically go from restaurant to restaurant having an app and drink at each stop so I cannot comment on their food or service other than the apps that I have had there which have been delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Max Solano is Emeril's master mixologist in Vegas and I believe he creates all the signature cocktails for Emeril's Vegas properties or maybe it's just the Venetian/Palazzo properties. Whatever the case may be this man can make a drink. Do yourself a favor and sit and the bar when Max is working and let him design or recommend a drink based on your personal tastes. I have given him just two ingredients that I was craving and had him invent a cocktail for the first time right there in front of me that would rate as the best I have ever had. He is a true artist behind the bar. He also boasts what is one of the most extensive whiskey inventories in the country!\n",
      "\n",
      "A cocktail or two by Max is a great way to start or end an evening and sometimes both in the same sitting but either way add a Solano cocktail to your Vegas must do list the next time you visit Vegas.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Dinner with my wife and 6 family members...no problem with reservations for this large part of a party.  Service was outstanding!  We all agreed that the steaks were some of the best we had ever eaten!  Seafood tower was very good!  Sides were very tasty and the creamed corn was SO GOOD!  Not sure how they prepared it, but it was some of the best ever.  Will definitely include this restaurant in our future visits to Las Vegas!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I am in love. In love with the ceasar salad prepared at our table by our very likable  waiter, in love with the steak medallions topped with lobster and drizzled with a wonderful bearnaise sauce... in fact I would be hard pressed to find anything to criticize about the experience we had here last week. Finally, the banana cream pie was nothing short of the totally perfect end to our evening. Fine wine, fine company, fine service and more than fine food. Dare I say it one more time??? In LOVE haha\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Food was excellent and drinks were okay. We had the ribeye (boneless) and ahi tuna and salmon with the BBQ shrimp appetizer. Added cream of corn (excellent!) and spinach (bland) and had a great dinner. Staff was accommodating and pleasant but a bit formal for our taste. We had a short wait on the front end of our visit but all in all very good.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Ordered the bone in ribeye, medium rare.  The first steak came out medium.  I was nervous to ask the waiter for a redo but he was so gracious and even acknowledged the medium steak.  It was replaced with a gorgeous medium rare steak in less than 5 mins.  Great service, good food, excellent atmosphere.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I could describe many above average facets of the meal I had at Delmonico, but the only one that really matters is that I walked out of this restaurant saying that this was the best steak I have ever had.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Kansas City cut (bone-in NY Strip) here is just so unbelievably perfect.  It is seared on the outside with a beautiful medium rare on the inside.  The texture is perfect.  The juiciness of the meat is perfect.  The salty flavor addition from the bone is perfect.  And what really made it for me was the seasoning on the steak itself.  Every bite had a little peppery bite that was the perfect combination of dancing around the edges of your tongue without being overbearing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.  A confluence of the perfection of all the individual elements that matter yields the distinction of Best Steak I Have Ever Had.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] 16 idiots donning wigs came to Delmonico for a bachelor party dinner.  I had called other steakhouses, but since we had a large party, I was told we had to order from a set menu.  Us clods just wanted a delicious slab of steak, some wine and we'd be happy and Delmonico was there to provide.  The only shortcoming was the wait to take our orders, but once our waiter came, it was all good.  The wait staff had a great sense of humor which added to the night's festivities (hell they were serving a bunch of goofballs).  Of course, the best part was the steak.  Most of us at the table had the bone in ribeye steak.  Let me first say I didn't eat much of anything that day in anticipation of this dinner and we didn't have any appetizers or salads and I STILL couldn't finish off that piece of meat!  My steak was perfectly cooked medium rare and was wonderfully seasoned.  Thanks to Delmonico for tolerating the circus sideshow and cooking up some awesome meat..  and sorry to housekeeping that we ordered 4 orders of asparagus!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Great service, great decor and ambiance, but food was weak.  Wedge salad had undercooked, fatty bacon on top. Roast duck was over-done, not juicy, but skin was rubbery.  Lots of folks do it better than Delmonico, keep looking.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My wife and I came here for our anniversary celebration last week. We had a show to attend at the Wynn so we needed to dine locally; I was debating on dining at CUT again or here but due to the high yelp reviews we decided to give Delmonico's a try.  I made reservations one month in advance online and notated our special occasion. \n",
      "Upon entry we were both promptly greeted, seated and our anniversary celebration was acknowledged - which was much appreciated. Service was kind, professional and very efficient but unfortunately the food - lacked significantly. \n",
      "\n",
      "We both began with the recommended BBQ Shrimp appetizer - which was phenomenal, but unfortunately that's where our ecstasy of taste buds had ended.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered my long awaited alleged highly reviewed bone in rib eye with a side of foie gras, mashed potatoes and sautéed mushrooms. \n",
      "\n",
      "To my unfortunate disappoint - the steak had tasted no different than a steak purchased from your local grocery store. For the price point and most importantly the anticipation I had for their signature steak from the world renowned chef, it DID NOT hit the spot. Although the steak came out at a perfect temperature and presentation was adequate, it did not at all taste like a typical dry aged high grade meat - very bland and mediocre, tasted no seasonings or flavor. We should have gone to Mastros or I would have at least been better off going back to CUT, although I didn't like the fact that CUT brings out their steaks lukewarm (due to resting) or not even on a hot plate - but you definitely get the high end meat quality and the explosion of flavors - hands down by far is 100% better.\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife had ordered the Mediterranean Sea bass since she wasn't in the mood for steak and as well to her disappointment it was a lackluster, flavorless dish. All in all it was a very disheartening anniversary meal after a month's of high anticipation especially with all of the other fine dining options we had in Vegas.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This place is a little gem.  Yes it is very pricey but the service combined with great food make it a great place to dine.  We had the NY Steak and Rib Eye along with the truffle chips, buttered broccoli and the chocolate cake. First the service is impeccable five star all the way.  The hosts have only a few tables and are very accessible while not being overbearing.  They have assistants that are every bit the professional as the hosts.  Was treated very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food is amazing.  The steaks are quite large and bone-in meaning great flavor.  I think better than Ruth's Chris even.  The sides were good the truffle chips are highly recommended!  and the pop-overs that they start with are good if not a bit heavy.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The chocolate cake was also great.  The place is pricey for sure but you get what you pay for here.  Highly recommend this place for a great experience!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Two of us went here to celebrate a birthday.  What an amazing experience.  You'd never know you're in the middle of a noisy casino - it is away from everything.  The atmosphere is quiet and sophisticated without being stuffy.  In fact, our wait staff team was a great combination of being knowledgeable and fun.  The wine list gave us an ample selection and we were not disappointed with our choices.  We treated ourselves to the rib eye steak and fillet meals with fingerling potato side.  It was wonderful - done as requested with amazing taste thanks to the way they prepare it.  We would have loved to try a dessert (the pictures looked wonderful) but were too full despite sharing the potato side dish.  Maybe next time, we'll split an entree, too so we have room for dessert.  Overall, the entire experience was a real treat.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Lobster bisque - 2 stars, lacks the BAM I was expecting from Emeril.  I've had better bisque at most average restaurants\n",

      "Delmonico Ribeye Steak - 5 stars, perfectly cooked and so flavorful and juicy.\n",

      "Price? Expect to hand over a Benjamin to the waiter per person with appetizer, wine, and dessert.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The steaks were very moist and tasty.  The service was not the best.  It was early in the evening and the place was not packed so to wait for 20 minutes for a steak seams a little too long.  Either way, that evened out to being about average for a place that was pretty expensive price point.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I gave this five stars because I feel it is the best steakhouse in Las Vegas. I have been to CUT, SW, Craft, and Del Frisco's, but Delmonico's takes the cake. We went in a large (all male) group so I wont describe each dish, but simply give a brief overview. The service and decor are both wonderful. You were given a relatively large amount of space, at least for a steakhouse. The appetizers, steaks, sides, and desserts are great! A must go to for those looking for an upscale, but great steak dinner. In terms of price, it is average for a Vegas steakhouse.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Delmonico Is a wonderful resturant. Every time I go I get the Filet and it just melts in my mouth. I think I actually had an orgasim at the table one time. I went there for my Birthday and they were wonderful. My dessert had my name in chocolate on top of it (thanks to my BF calling days in advanced). If you can afford it, go there. Yummie. Steak Melting in my mouth, with a delious butter reduction.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] A Las Vegas classic, great steaks, a nice rendition of the Manhattan original.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The most amazing French onion soup I've ever had!  Really, the food was delicious. Wonderful service.  Only complaint was the ambience.   The decor is \"modern vacant\". Completely devoid of artistry.   The food makes up for the absence of decor\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Disappointed. Steak overdone while waiter have come 4 times to ask everything okay. Well will not come next time.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I say 3.8 stars. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's absolutely what I would expect going in. I didn't think it was anything really special about it. My steak was cooked perfectly and the sides we ordered (musrooms, mashed potatoes, and shoot I can'r remember is they were green beans or asparagus) were all tasty. \n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Delmonico is the definition of fine dining.  Delicious food and excellent service.  It was like the serving staff were magicians.  Always there when you needed them, and even when you didn't know you needed them.  \n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I've walked by Delmonico and stopped to look at the menu many times as I've gone through restaurant row on my way to/from the parking garage at the Palazzo.  With a show later, I made an early reservation for Delmonico.  I was promptly greeted and seated.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew the steaks were large unless I got a petit filet (not my favorite cut of steak) so I ordered a bone in ribeye, a side of cheesy grits with bacon, and then bread pudding for dessert. I had a trio of servers who took good care of service.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the steak cooked blue and it was close to that but a bit beyond.  The steak was quite average.  The steak was pre-seasoned and it was OK.  The star of dinner was the cheesy grits with bacon.  They were very good!\n",
      "\n",
      "The bread pudding was white chocolate macadamia nut with creme Anglaise.  It was OK, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dinner never had any wow factor to merit the prices charged.  Things were average except the grits.  I thought the dried branches on the poinsettia on the wall by my table reflected the lack of attention to detail one would expect of a high end restaurant like Delmonico.  \n",

It melts  in your mouth its so tender. The reason I say this is the place  you want to go is because  the service is as good as the meal.\n",
      "Your not stretching your neck  looking  for your server.  Water glasses were always  full and our steaks all landed  at the same time  by 3 servers.\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I was treated to a lovely birthday dinner here and was pleasantly surprised.  The restaurant is a lot bigger than it actually looks.  Walking past it in the Venetian, you wouldn't believe it extends back to a full restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ambiance is elegant, comfortable, but friendly.  The manager came out before our meal to greet us and wish me a happy birthday, which was rather special.  The wine list was over 100 pages long and took us quite some time to decide which bottle to get.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had the truffle & parmesan potato chips, which were just okay, and a small charcuterie plate with homemade cheese chips.\n",
      "For our main courses, I ordered the filet mignon.  My date ordered the bone in ribeye with foie gras.  My steak was arguable the best steak I've ever had.  It was perfectly buttery, seared and charred on the outside but tender, moist, juicy, and pink on the inside.  I had a bite of the ribeye with foie gras, which was just savory overload.\n",
      "For dinner, we received a complimentary \"Happy Birthday\" sorbet with a candle in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a great experience there and would go back again for the steak.  I only gave 4 stars and not 5 because the other menu items (starters and sides) were very forgettable.  The steak however, was unforgettable. \n",

      "Awesome thing, no split plate charges. My gfs and I were not yearning to eat a 22 oz steak, so it was nice to be able to split the entrees. We ordered the bone-in rib eye. YOU MUST ORDER that, especially if you're a steak eater. Medium rare, and that's how steak should always be. We also tried the Grilled Filet Mignon Medallions, which we overdone, Medium Rare my a$$, it was more like medium well-well done. but it did have a good taste. I don't believe in returning food.\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Sweet Jesus, is this place overrated. I realize that top shelf restaurants in Las Vegas are pricey, but discriminating judgment should not be thrown out the window completely. Delmonico's is easily in the bottom third of dining options on the Strip, and maybe even that is too generous. There are at least 5 better options in The Venetian alone. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've had better rib eye steaks for $0.99. Their wine list sucks, too. I expect an upcharge but if I'm going to pay through the nose, at least give me something that wasn't fermented in a toilet.\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Delicious steak dinner!  I was a little skeptical about trying Delmonico Steakhouse since some reviews I had read were negative.  But we had a great experience.  The service was attentive but not intrusive.  Everything we ordered was delicious!  I started with the mixed greens salad and my husband got the shrimp cocktail appetizer.  I got the filet mignon and my husband got the bone in rib eye.  Both were cooked perfectly and very good, but not the best steaks we ever had.  We also got the sauteed mushrooms and country smashed potatoes for sides.  We couldn't fit in dessert.  The wine list, or book I should say, was the largest we've seen.  Definitely worth the trip and I would recommend it.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Wow, I can't believe this place getting 4 stars. BAM to POOF to me.\n",
      "First off the bread ... if you do not know now to make a simple bread ... how hard it is ... even my homemade bread taste better than that hard piece of rock they served. \n",
      "Maybe it was just a bad day for me. But it cannot be that bad right. nooo ... but sorry to say ... it is a yes for me.\n",
      "Waiter ... service ... zero! rude and didn't ask if we are done and took everything away ... but the food was bad anyways take it away as fast as you can.\n",
      "Jumbo shrimp and petite fiilet mignon ... non fresh shrimp made for bad combo plus ... I ordered medium rare and it came out well done. hmm ... either the waiter doesn't know how to write his order or the head chef or whoever is cooking is just as bad as emeril lagasse himself. \n",
      "Then to coffee ... argh ... disgusting ... and we were like complaining and the waiter came by and asked ... we can brew a fresh one for you??? ... i was like WTF ... this was not a fresh brew to began with ... argh disgusting and chills all over my body ... so time to get out pronto!!!\n",

      "I am usually a New York Strip guy, but I was hungry so I opted for the bone in ribeye for the first time here.  Birthday girl had the filet mignon. Sides included smashed potatoes and broccoli. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bone in ribeye: Humongous! Probably 20oz. +  Beautifully crusted, with just the right amount of seasoning. Steak as always, cooked perfectly medium rare, which made for an amazingly juicy and flavorful experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "Filet Mignon: Now normally I am not a filet person, but I did try a piece or maybe two.  Beautiful crust and to my surprise it also had excellent flavor.  Tender as you would expect from a great cut of Filet Mignon.  However, still not as juicy as my steak was.\n",

      "\n",
      "I ordered a glass of wine, the bone in rib eye, the bone in new york, cream of corn, and a twice baked potato. The server kept insisting we add an appetizer and a half bottle of wine to our order. I know its their job to encourage customers to order more, but I had a sense the server felt like I wasn't spending enough to justify exceptional service.\n",
      "\n",
      "This may be a pet-peeve of mine, but I hate it when the server doesn't bring you the bill nor does he bring you back the bill after you paid. The runner did this. The runner also was the one who asked if I would like dessert. I know its a busy restaurant, but the server could have brought back the bill and asked if I enjoyed everything (what if something was wrong?). Again this is a pet-peeve of mine.\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] So my buddies wanted to go to a legit steakhouse in Vegas and we decided to try Delmonico.  We shared the seafood platter for an appetizer and how can you go wrong with king crab, oysters, and lobster.  I ordered the gumbo and it was delicious and full of depth and flavor.  The star of this dinner was the bone in Ribeye!  Perfectly charred on the outside and so tender and moist in the inside.  Best piece of steak I have had in my life, so far. Lol  I'm not a fan of fat on steak but the fat on this steak melted in my mouth and was as close to steak butter as there is.  My friends ordered sides but the steak was so big I didn't have room for anything else.  I think we ordered to much food and we had lots of leftovers. I could have shared the steak and I would have felt perfect.  This place is expensive but worth every penny.  If you feel like treating yourself this is a great place to eat.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Not good for lunch.  Atmosphere is too austre and quiet-like trying to dine in church.  they dont even pipe any music in.  the lobster sliders were filled with about a tablespoon of lobster and at least that much mayonnaise.  Fries had been sitting too long and gotten hard.  Good service and good wine list but overall not worth the $70 pricetag for lunch.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I've been here twice so far and I'd have to say the first experience was the best even though they burned my steak.  Be aware that due to the way they cook their steaks you probably don't want anything over medium.  My GF hates raw meat so we ordered medium well and got a black looking steak.  I did complain and was told it was due to the way the prepare the steaks.  They did comp the steak which made things better.  I'm an appetizer man so I ordered several appetizers.  They were all excellent especially the Fois Gras dish.  \n",
      "\n",
      "What made my second experience less memorable?  MENU CHANGES!  Even though I knew how to order my steak perfectly now, they changed the appetizer menu on me.  They no longer offer ANY Fois Gras!!!  I asked the reason for this and was told they had people protesting about the item so they discontinued it.  I was so looking forward to it that it ruined my whole night.  I sub'd the Fois Gras with the Truffle Oil Home Made Potato chips and those are probably the best chips you'll ever have.  Desserts must not have been good because I don't even remember what I had.\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Best experience out of all the restaurants in Vegas. The service was 5 star. We felt like royalty. The Salmon and Filet Mignon were amazing. Most impressive dessert I've had, banana pudding with a delicious twist. \n",

      "3 of us dined here on a Thursday night. It didn't look crowded from the outside, but once we went back into the dining area, we were shocked by how huge it is and how crowded it was.  We had a lovely table and great service.  But more importantly, seriously stellar food.\n",
      "\n",
      "Per usual in my world, my group ordered a bunch of things to share.  (I don't know why everyone doesn't do this- it just makes dining so much more fun).  ORDER THE FILET MIGNON!!! The seasoning is insanely delicious- sort of a creole/Cajun/NOLA seasoning profile that danced in my mouth.  High quality, beautiful cut of steak, perfectly cooked with a unique flavor profile-- how can you go wrong??  Also, our awesome server sliced it for us to make it easy to share-- loved that!! \n",
      "\n",
      "The salmon was also perfectly cooked and delicious.  The hash underneath was great too, and played well with the fish seasoning.  The mushrooms side is OUTSTANDING!  If you are a mushroom lover, these are some don't-miss shroomies.  We also got the buttered broccoli.  It is totally simple and tasted like what you'd have at home, but with such a heavy and strong flavored meal, this was some spot on, solid freshness, too.  No complaints from me!!\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We visited this past week and were disappointed in the food. Given the restaurant's high rating and prices, my steak was lacking. The steak had a thick salty crust, which I did not care for. The chips and service were very good though!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Food was great.  I had the aged Rib Eye, and my wife had the Filet Mignon Medallions.  The service was top notch.  Attention to detail.  I will be back!\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This place is located in the Venetian.  Went for a prix fixe dinner that offered one starter, entree and a dessert.  We both got the bbq shrimp as the starter.  The shrimp didn't come out carmelized from being cooked on a bbq, it was served with bbq sauce.  They were good.   One of us got the little fillet and the other got the salmon entrees.  Both meals were great.  We were disappointed with the desserts.  The chocolate cake was hard.  The banana creme pie was also a little hard; appeared like it was layers of banana and cheesecake.  Not what I expected.  So, minus one star for the dessert.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We ordered the Chateau Brian and it was awesome!  The steak cheese fondue is to die for.  Quality of beef was very good.  Service is good beside the fact that there is a huge party in front of us.  LOL.  One of the best steakhouse in Vegas I would say.  Will come back during slower, non-trade show time to experience better service.\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I celebrated Christmas here with my family in 2014. My grandfather had cancer and wanted an authentic caesar salad since his appetite was back and he felt better. The service was  outstanding and so was the food. My sister and I had to split a T-bone steak because it was so big. We devoured it in about 3 minutes because it just melted. It was seasoned perfectly and the side orders we picked came in generous portions (we had to take them home).  My grandfather loved the salad he kept saying it was exactly what he was craving. It was the first time I'd eaten a correctly made caesar and it was extremely well flavored. Everyone was so stuffed and we had tons of food left over. As I stated before the service was outstanding I day this because my grandfather started feeling pain and needed to be taken home to have his medication immediately. They let half of us leave to escort him to our ride and we hadn't even paid or bill. They discreetly packed up or food and took our payment after they were sure his situation was handled, they even offered to have security bring a wheel chair and escort us out the Venetian. That was the last Christmas meal I will ever share with him because he recently passed away but thanks to the understanding, kindness, and professionalism of the staff I will forever have a beautiful memory.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] AMAZING. The food speaks for it's self &I the service was beyond amazing. Will not be disappointed.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Amazing service and delicious food!  Steak cooked perfectly.  Sides were all yummy!  The biggest baked potato I have ever seen!  All sides are sharable portions!  Wait staff kept my water glass refilled, this is extremely important to me, as that is all I drink.  Noisy atmosphere, but there were 7 of us, so not bothersome.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Great steaks, great service and the banana cream pie was over the top.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I bring customers for dinner here every year during the ISC trade show for the past 7 years- and it always is the right decision. The drinks are some of the best on the strip, the Lobster Bisque and locally grown tomato salad ( yep a greenhouse in Vegas and the cheese made in house)  is to die for, and everyone that had steak said it was full of flavor and cooked perfectly. I had the Salmon special and it was great as their fish dishes always are.  Until last week I was never a fan of Key Lime pie- but when we got several desserts for the table the Key Lime pie was one of them.. and although I went in with hesitation... it was hands down the best dessert on the table...so the new rule for me is Key Lime Pie- but only at Delmonico!  As all things with the Emeril name impeccable service was our experience - even with a trade show crowd and a large private whiskey tasting event. Our water glasses were never less than 2/3 full, a server was always there for another drink or any issue. The pace of our meal was first rate. I'll be back again next year!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] 3 stars for the wine list.   2 for the steak.  I've gotta say that the service and ambiance was astounding given they let me bring my 3 foot tall yard full of long island ice tea, from the flamingo no less, to the table.  Greater than that? the wait staff were kind enough to fill it up with ice for me as I left it sitting there, as our center piece.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The wine list was insane.  It must have been 50 pages.  In the end we ended up going with something simple because we were already pretty hammered from our fun in the sun.  The appetizers were decent from what I remember, but the anti-pasto salad looked like cold cuts from my mom's fridge.  It just wasn't presented well for the type of clout this place assumes.  So here I am, dining Euro style waiting 2 hours for the steak to finally arrive, chewing on my day old bologna and it finally arrives...\n",
      "\n",
      "...and it sucks!  I got the bone in rib-eye, one of my favorite cuts, and it was \"toasted\" excessively and really lacked any distinguishable flavor!  I couldn't believe that i was paying this kind of money for a steak I was making in my BBQ baby years.  And you know how sometimes things taste so, so good when you're trashed?  I couldn't imagine my feelings had I been sober.  \n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not so sure it was all bad - my friends had some pretty good Filet, and the soup was good from what I understand.  It's just not going to be MY first choice for a favorite dining spot in Vegas.  Like I said though, the wait staff was great, the wine list amazing, and the silverware clean.  \n",

One of the girls got the rib-eye, and I personally shared the new york strip with a friend.    I feel like I'm paying a premium for Vegas and/or Emeril.     Don't get me wrong, you'll definitely get a nice fat, juicy, flavorful steak here.     But I felt like I was getting more of my money's worth with the Kona Crusted Steak at Capital Grille (Chicago) or the Cowboy Cut at Taste of Texas (Houston).    The meat quality was much better and believe it or not, much more flavorful than Delmonico's steaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, if you do go to Dominico's, definitely get the sautee'd mushrooms on the side.   Its a nice garlicky mix of mushrooms that compliments perfectly with the steaks!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] One of the better steaks I've had. Crispy on the outside and soft and juicy on the inside. Very pricey.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Came for lunch mid-day and it was not crowded.  Service was exceptional but food was so disappointing.\n",
      "I LOVED Emeril's restaurant in New Orleans (NOLA) and I was sooo excited but this was a let down.  \n",
      "I had the ceasar and it was fine but nothing compared to the one at NOLA (which was the best one of my life).  The ricotta grilled cheese was bland (but good in that comfort food kind of way).  The tomato soup it came with was good--nothing special.\n",
      "The dessert (apple fritters) were amazing--mini-apple crispy pies with good ice cream.  I would go back for only that.  Otherwise, nothing special and a personal let down.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I've been here a total of three times.  All great experiences.  Their filet mignon, new york steak, and bone-in rib-eye were all done to perfections!  The cuts were thick yet so soft when you eat them.  Hats off to their chefs.  The steak were done so perfect you really don't need to dip the meat in sauce or butter, etc.  It's so flavorful as is.  Pricey?  Yes very.  Which is the only reason that might keep me from frequenting this restaurant as much as I would like to.  I don't think they have a dress code.  But, I would recommend dressing up a bit when you go here.  Otherwise you would stand out and be embarrass like I was one time.  Happy eating!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I've been here a few times.... All I have to say is....Finally a place that knows how make a steak!  I came here for dinner and lunch.  I also had a chance to try their burger. The juiciest and tastiest burger I have ever had. I would definitely come back for future meals as well as recommend this place to others.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Service was great... !! We sat down to a late dinner to find the restaurant was extremely busy and still great service. Ordered the chateaubriand for two & was not disappointed. Nice sides were included - Asparagus & garlic mashed potatoes. Very generous portions. The popovers before the meal were perfect. Unfortunately we had no room left for desert. If you have not been to Delmonico ... Make it a stop on your next trip.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] EXCELLENT!! Everything was perfect...Ambiance, Service, especially the food.  Wished I had a bigger appetite to hold more food.   There were 3 of us girls sharing the Vine-Ripened Tomato Salad with the Burrata Cheese ~ Excellent!   We weren't very hungry so we shared the Chateaubriand among the 3 of us. It was a perfect size for 3 people.  The portions were well divided with enough sides and steak to go around for 3 people.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We wished we had a bigger appetite to order dessert and try Truffle Potato Chips. Can't wait til my next Vegas trip to try out more of the menu.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Finally made it here after wanting to go for so many years.  From the moment we got there we were greeted by the hosting area and whisked away to our table.  They pulled the chairs out for me and my guest and made sure we were comfortable.  They even asked if I wanted my jacket placed on the empty seat next to me, wow.  Head waiter came over and introduced himself and his team that were going to serve us for the night.  Sommelier came over and asked if I need any help picking out a wine.  being the wine geek that I am I had no problem browsing thru the incredible list/book and picked out a delicious red burgundy.  We ordered the truffled potato chips and boy were they good, yummo.  We skipped on a big appetizer because we didn't want to get too full.  We both ordered the Bone In RIb Eye and it was one of the best steaks I have ever eaten that I was sucking the tasty bone with no shame.  One incredible meal and one of the best I have had in Vegas.  This is the place and I will be back for sure...\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] One of the most all-time memorable dining experiences I've ever had.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Though I am vegetarian now, my mouth *STILL* waters at the thought of the filet mignon I had at Delmonico's.  It was simply unrivaled by any other steak I've ever had and probably any other steak I ever will have.  I sincerely doubt that in my life I will ever -- EVER -- have a better steak.  It was perfectly cooked, and coated with the perfect amount of pepper and spices on all sides.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, but certainly not any less impressive, was the ceasar salad.  As somebody who orders ceasar salad everywhere she goes, I would venture to say that this was in the top three I've ever had -- I could probably even safely say it was the best.  Served with whole leaves, which I love, and the dressing was made at our table, right in front of our eyes.\n",

      "Cannot be beat.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] ABSOLUTE MUST IN VEGAS! Loved everything my boyfriend and I got and the service was amazing! Seriously this place is amazing\n",

      "\n",
      "Delmonico / Emeril's staff reached out to me via Yelp a couple of days after I posted the review, and I ended up having a good conversation with their Director of Operations in Las Vegas.  Mike told me he reviewed the events of the evening with the staff at Delmonico, including the mistakes that were made and ways to ensure it doesn't happen in the future.  He asked that I give them another chance and let him know when I'm going to be in Vegas again, which I most certainly will. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm very impressed with their response and how they took the review as an opportunity to improve. \n",
      "\n",
      "ORIGINAL REVIEW - \n",
      "\n",
      "One of the worst high end Las Vegas restaurant experiences I've ever had.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dinner started out alright.  Larger party of 15, restaurant spread us across 2 tables instead of handling us as one; acceptable, but not thrilling. Initial greeting with menus and wine lists was prompt and fast. \n",
      "\n",
      "After that, follow up service to get drink orders and appetizers was very slow. Orders were finally taken and again, return to deliver the drinks took a while. \n",
      "\n",
      "When time came to order, my wife and I were among the first in the group.  I ordered a tableside Caesar for 2, a Special bone in filet medium rare for my wife and a special bone in filet blue (think less cooked than rare, if you don't know it) for myself. \n",
      "\n",
      "The pop-overs are fantastic, and the tableside Caesar was great. The gentleman who prepared it was kind enough to give me a couple of hints how they do the Caesar dressing which I'm looking forward to trying in my own Caesar dressing. \n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, the wheels came off the bus. I finished my glass of wine with the Caesar and tried repeatedly to signal our waiter John for another glass and failed. My wife got into trying to get his attention as well and failed multiple times before finally succeeding. \n",
      "\n",
      "Rough bus, meet out of control bus. Dinner arrives, and my wife and I are simultaneously served Bone In Ribeyes. Hers medium rare, mine blue (our order was Filets - medium rare and blue). We promptly object and are corrected at first by the waitstaff that we got what we ordered (we never order Ribeyes as we both like our steaks too rare for a ribeye's flavor to come out).\n",
      "\n",
      "The waiter comes over after some confusion and tells me he brought me what I ordered. After some quick discussion our incorrect steaks are removed and we're told our Special of the evening, Bone In Filets, are on their way. \n",
      "\n",
      "Not minutes later, we're told they've sold out of the special and we can have regular filets. Since the rest of our group has already been eating we just say fine, whatever, bring us a medium rare and a blue filet. \n",
      "\n",
      "Three different people drop by to apologize to us, a total of 8 times across them. Frankly it creeped us out a bit. \n",
      "\n",
      "When our new steaks finally arrived, they sat them down saying \"here is your medium and rare filets\".  When we cut in to them, we did get 1 medium and 1 rare filet but 0 medium rare and 0 blue filets. We just accepted them and went forth. \n",
      "\n",
      " The flavor of the filets were good, as was the texture and seasoning. \n",
      "\n",
      "After the steak disaster, I did not have to struggle to get another glass of wine fortunately!!\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't say the side of grits with cheese and bacon was all that great since it sat there getting cold and congealing the whole time they were figuring out the steak issue. \n",
      "\n",
      "We passed on dessert, having lost all confidence on the restaurant. We did order a decaf coffee and a 10 year tawny port for me. The waiter offered to buy the port for me, i.e. comp it, but that seems a small consolation compared to blowing the whole main course in such an epic fashion. \n",
      "\n",
      "Can't recommend you avoid Delmonico enough. With so many other options around here, don't risk wasting your hard earned dollar (or luckily won one) here.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Lissa G and I stopped in for lunch.  We've been meaning to go to Delmonico's for years since we are often in Las Vegas and always stay at the Palazzo.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ate at the bar and watched some of the New Year's Eve college football game.  I think the volume was on the TV but we really couldn't hear it, hopefully other times they just have some music playing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was kind of mixed on the food. The French Onion Soup is a must try! The broth was so deep and rich that you could taste the hours of preparation and simmering. The Tomato and Burrata dish was fine, as was the Ribeye Steak we ordered. Again, not bad, just ok when I compare them to their competitors in the hotel, like Carnavino or Bouchon where we often go for lunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will have to try dinner next time but if you are going don't miss the onion soup!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The food was delicious!  Everyone was very sweet and attentive.  Mike and Drew took very good care of us.  Mike knew the menu well and knew all about the various cuts of beef.  I was duly impressed.  Also, thank you to Drew for taking it all in stride.  If he reads this, he will know what I mean.  I would definitely dine there again!!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Typical day in Vegas couldn't decide where to eat (too many choices). Decided to go to Delmonico Steakhouse in the Venetian. Service was pretty prompt as usual with this place. We ordered the Caesar Salad that was prepared table side, I believe I ordered a  bone in rib-eye and my girlfriend ordered the salmon. All of the food was prepared well and service was perfection. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends and family.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Everything about this place was amazing.  The food, the service, the ambiance, it couldn't have been better.  We began our meal with bbq shrimp, bone-in bacon, and lobster bisque, all of which were delicious.  Now on to the steaks. We ordered bone-in ribeyes and this was by far the best steak I've ever had. It was perfectly prepared and the flavor was out of this world. For our sides we ordered sautéed mushrooms and grits, both of which were equally delicious.  We finished our meal with dessert and we ended up with two, the pecan pie and the caramel butter cake, both of which were, you guessed it, delicious!\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's talk about the staff and the service.  From the host that greeted us when we walked in, to the gentleman that walked us to our seats, to the three gentlemen that served us, everything and everyone was absolutely delightful.  The three gentlemen serving us were Rene, Brian, and David, and they ran like a well oiled machine.  They were very attentive and very pleasant people, and they helped make our dining experience so wonderful. \n",
      "\n",
      "The ambiance was perfect for our early xmas dinner.  We had a table where we were able to comfortably eat dinner, have a conversation without screaming at each other, and we weren't wedged between other people being forced to share our dining experience with strangers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely a five star establishment with five star food and five star service. We will definitely be back.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We recently came here for our second time for our anniversary. We were craving a seafood tower and we had liked this place before and we were in the Venetian. \n",
      "\n",
      "We sat in the bar and had a wonderful server. Very personable, accommodating and very nice. The atmosphere is still the same great upbeat, fun and relaxing (yes all at the same time). The drinks were good as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing that lacked was the seafood tower. The highlight of the meal, the thing we were looking forward to the most, what we were drooling for. A couple of the dipping sauces were delicious but their substitute for cocktail sauce tasted like marinara sauce. Overly sweet and not a good mix with shrimp. Maybe I am biased because I love the kick of horseradish in my cocktail sauce. The biggest complaint though, was the seafood felt dry or freezer burned. We still ate it because I wasn't going to let them waste the food and was in too much of a good mood to complain, but for the $, maybe I should have. \n",
      "\n",
      "So this trip was a love hate. We got way better service but the food lacked and isn't that what should rock my world at a restaurant of this caliber?\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas, somewhere I know I can go and get a great steak and have a great atmosphere to share with friends or family.  I have been going to Delmonico since about four year ago and I have never been disappointed once.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of my favorite things about this place is every time I have made a reservation I have always got seated almost exactly on time.  This place is not cheap nor is it too overpriced compared to other steakhouses in Las Vegas that don't even come close to this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of my favorite things is they have an great selection of scotches and bourbon, the have a separate menu for it and if you like either please make sure and check it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Give this place a try and know that I recommend it to everyone.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Wonderful experience! Classic service, friendly wait staff, perfectly mixed cocktails, and flavorful food. Our salads were absolutely perfect, the dressings on both were incredible. Our steaks were juicy and cooked to perfection - both of us got the rib-eye and all its flavorful goodness was all over the plate. I was however, surprised at the lack of ambiance in this place. It's got really nothing going for it but tables and good service and good food. I guess you don't need much more than that, but it's Vegas for goodness' sakes. Liven up the decor a bit! But go, please. You won't regret it.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Thought it was incredible. My steak was phenomenal. My girlfriend got the lobster special. Hand made pasta, lobster, in a black truffle butter sauce. The food was top notch, great ambiance, great experience.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Just hit this place for the 3rd time in 2 years and this place never let's down.  I was there just this past weekend during a very busy time at the Venetian with 2 major conventions going on.  We were fortunate enough to get a reservation with the host we prefer at 7:30 pm.  Game on!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Service is impeccable.  We have a specific host who takes care of us when we come in so I suggest you get to know yours cause it does make getting reservations much easier.  Not only that, but you have a better time in general when you feel you have a friend there.  And trust me, I'm no high roller.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each section has its own host and several supporting cast.  Some hosts are better than others so again if you like yours try to stick with him/her.  They usually start you with an amuse bouche compliments of the chef.  Always different and always outstanding.  It's no meal just a way of getting your taste buds started.  The food will be brought as per normal or as you request.  You're in control so let them know what you want and they will help you better.  Even with wine selections of which they have a large selection.  The place can get a lot of hustle (not normal) so just try to sit tight and enjoy your meal.  They won't rush you so don't rush yourself.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I go straight for the steak but i hear the appetizers are fantastic.  I highly recommend the Wet/Dry Aged Bone In Rib Eye Medium.  The outside will be crusted just right with a pat of house made butter on top.  Inside will be pink and juicy (order med/rare if you want blood) and soft not chewy.  The meat will melt in your mouth as this cut has just the right amount of marbling (great now I want one).  Desert?  The steak is desert enough for me (lol).  \n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We were invited to dinner here as part of a work office getaway in LV. Prior to arrival, I had whisked thru the menu as well as some reviews. I was actually expecting to be disappointed. I assumed that the prices might sway the opinions of many.\n",
      "\n",
      "Man, was I wrong. We walked in to this modern but simply decorated establishment on time and our party of 11 were immediately seated. Michael was our head server and he made sure we received water, a wine list and our menus.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had noticed that a summer trio for $65 was available so that is the angle I decided to take. I felt a little guilty that our employer was eating this tab so I wanted to be fair. I ordered the Mini Wedge, the Petite Rib-Eye and a Caramel Butter Cake a la mode. Most went this route although some selected the STRIP. You think Vegas had something to do with that?\n",
      "\n",
      "My salad was good but I thought the Bleu Cheese on the plate was a bit understated. I do like Bleu Cheese with some POP. My Rib-Eye was called petite but it was still a plentiful portion. It was prepared PERFECTLY and the Chimichurri applied on top had the old taste buds doing somersaults.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The dessert which is offered by itself was upgraded with a scoop of ice cream with Michael's recommendation. His idea was spot on. All in all, everyone enjoyed their FABULOUS meals. We laughed, conversed and immersed ourselves in each other. We definitely had a relaxing dinner. \n",
      "\n",
      "The evening would not have been as grand without the service we received. Michael and his staff performed impeccably. The service was orchestrated and attentive. Make sure to stroll in one evening and ask if Michael can take care of you. You will not regret it.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I really wanted to love this - I had very high expectations going in...unfortunatly, well, maybe I caught them on an off night..\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's start with the wine list - the night in question they were out of the slightly over $100 (inexpensive for the restaurant) bottle of Cab that I selected,  Not really a problem - found one that cost just a little more.  However, later in the meal one of the waiters informed me of another Cab (not on the list) that cost about the same as the one I originally selected but was much better than the one I ended up with. Why not inform me of this BEFORE I selected another bottle?  Strike one.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a Sunday night and I was informed that they were out of the special of the day - some sort of fish. Again not a problem as we came in for BEEF.  Just thought I would mention it...\n",
      "\n",
      "The wedge salad - the bacon bits served with it were cold, greasy, and very tough.  Not good. The salad itself was fine - good blue cheese and nice and crisp- but for what you are paying the bacon should have been as well. Strike two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now on to the steak.- the \"signature\" bone in rib eye. It was good. Very good in fact. - a huge cut cook just as I orded. But...it was kind of bland. Not totally lacking in flavor but still kind of bland.  Not bad, but not the best steak I had ever eaten.  My friend's filet was also very good - an excellent cut cooked as ordered but still a bit - shall we say?- unseasoned?  Call this half a strike.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now on to the pecan pie and ice cream thingy - yummy. Best part of the meal!\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, Emeril's Delmonico is not bad.  Just that I was expecting more...\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] First time here during Christmas week and it was AMAZING. The whole experience was awesome! The service was phenomenal and the food tasted like fireworks in your mouth. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had the the bone-in rib eye...it just melted in your mouth and it wasn't overwhelming with steak sauce either. Just how I like my meat. I love and appreciate the taste of meat by itself. I personally feel steak sauces take away from the authenticity of the taste and the quality of the meat. My boyfriend had a crab salad and the doublecut kurobuta pork chop. I'm not a big fan of pork in general but this was a super delicious dish. \n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, we did not have any appetizers or dessert because we were still full from the buffet we had for lunch. Very regretful but I can't wait to go back and try some more things!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Excellent steakhouse. Every time I visit Las Vegas I make sure to get a comp for Delmonico. It consistently remains a solid restaurant. One of my favorite restaurants overall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service is great.\n",

      "\n",
      "I would highly recommend that you discuss with your server the definition of medium rare and medium. I know one time a friend said it was undercooked for medium rare, but honestly it was fine. He had a different definition for medium rare based on past experiences with \"other steakhouses\" (but I am not sure I would refer to them as real steakhouses).\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This was the best steak dinner I have had in Vegas hands down.  The portions are HUGE so you will leave very full.  The caprese salad was really good and the steak was amazing.  I was not so impressed with their dessert menu.  I would definitely come back.  My only complaint was that a meal takes a while at this place so be prepared for a leisurely dinner here.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Great ambiance. Great Service. things we ordered 3.5\n",
      "\n",
      "-Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp: This was not good. I would have rather had just shrimp and salt.\n",
      "-Ahi Tuna & Salmon Tartare: This was average. It was tasty, I enjoyed it but nothing stood out from it. \n",
      "-Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips: Guys at our table couldn't get enough of it. It was really good. The truffle oil was amazing!\n",
      "-Caesar Salad Prepared Tableside for Two: This was okay. It was kinda cool they made it for you on the side fresh. Small portion for the cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "-Bone-in Ribeye: This was very juicy, had tons of flavor. There were some spots where it was very chewy but still very good.  The portion size was very big. Some of the guys could not finish it.\n",
      "-New Orleans Creamed Spinach- I didnt like it at first but I acquired the taste and thought it was tasty by the last bite I had.\n",
      "-Creamed Corn Gratinée - VERY GOOD. first item to go at our table\n",
      "Sautéed Garlic Wild Mushrooms- great mushrooms, hard to mess it up. but a good compliment to the steak\n",
      "\n",
      "-Pecan Pie - First off I like pecna\n",
      "-Emeril's Banana Cream Pie - This was good one of the better banana cream pie I had, but the pecan pie was just too good that this just tasted alright.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I think this place can serve bologna sandwiches and still get a 5-star rating solely based on how good their customer service and wait staff is here! We started out with the fried oysters and the petite wedge salads. The oysters were incredibly fresh and crispy. Do the pro move and ask the waiter to bring out some crystals hot sauce to put on the top if you really want to make it Cajun, also smeared some blue cheese on top of mine from my wife salad which made it over the top good. For the main course we split the Chateaubriand and the cut was really  nice and seasoned and came with a side of asparagus and Lebanese potatoes. On our next visit I think we will stick with getting just the bone in ribeye as it looked a little better and then ordering our sides ala carte. For dessert we had the banana cream pie which was not overly sweet and the contrast  with the chocolate shavings on top giving it that slight bitter taste mixing with that creamy goodness.  The cappuccino was very good and was the excellent end cap to an extraordinary meal.\n",

      "My 1st 2 visits were awesome, great steaks and sides and good service, then something happened on my 3rd trip about 1 1/2 years ago, the food was just o.k. not horrible but nothing that great. Well a few weeks ago we were back at the Venetian.  I was there with my Wife, 2 sons(16 and 5) and my Sister in Law, everyone wanted steak, so we decided why not let's try Delmonico's.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turns out this was a bad choice and one that will keep me from going back, with all the new crops of good steakhouses(many within the same hallway) that have popped up since this place has opened, Delmonico's needs to get it's act together.\n",

      "When we were sat, we immediately were served water and our drink orders taken, that was the highlight of the meal. It took about 20 minutes to get our drinks and orders taken. When we asked if they had anything specific for our 5 year old, they suggested the burger, fine he can have that, if not my Wife would have just split some of her filet with him\n",
      "\n",
      "When our food came about 50 minutes later, mind you the place had just opened and there were no more than 4 other tables occupied. They put all our food down in front of us and they then proceeded to give my son a burger that had to have been at least 12 ounces, we all looked at each other and then commented on how and why would they serve him that.  Mind you, waiter suggested this burger for the 5 yr old.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back to the other plates, it was just large chunks of flavorless meat, the sides were bland and the truffled chips were soaking in oil. When it was all over and done we had been there almost 2 hours and were out almost $300. I have no problem spending good money for a good meal, but this meal left us feeling like we had wasted our time and our money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will not go back.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This absolutely by far is my favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas. I went here again on my 29th birthday, and the service was amazing as always. I ordered the ribeye to share along with the best lobster bisque you will ever have. Also the truffle potato chips are to die for. The restaurant is very classy and a bit pricey, however, you get what you pay for. I've tried pretty much all of the restaurants at the Venetian, and I have to stay this one is my absolute favorite. The steaks come out a perfect medium rare cooked to perfection in butter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since this is a popular restaurant, I highly recommend making a reservation in advance. It's a nice restaurant to take a date as well as to celebrate a special occasion.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I love a good steak. Filets are my favorite. I have to say that the Filet I had at the Delmonico Steakhouse was one of the best I've ever had. Maybe even the best. The char on it was perfect, the inside a perfect medium. If I had one complaint - it'd be that I didn't order two of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The side dishes and dessert were also delicious, and the service was amazing as well. Of course, the price was expensive, but I would hope no one going to this restaurant would be surprised by the price. You get what you pay for.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm keeping the review short - if you don't mind paying good money for a great meal, then go here. You will not regret it.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I'm a big fan of Emeril's cooking and love his steakhouse within The Venetian hotel. I always stay at adjoining The Palazzo and love walking through both hotels to arrive at the restaurant. The filets are amazing! Perfectly cooked medium rare just the way I like it and wonderfully seasoned. Service is excellent with an extensive wine list. The BBQ shrimp is delicious and do try desserts. We had a fantastic dinner here. Thank you Emeril!\n"

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] On our stay at the Venetian, we decided to try this steak house one night.\n",
      "I had the ribeye and my wife went for the filet mignon. Both steaks were absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection. The server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu .\n",
      "For the desert we opted to share the bread pudding,and I have to say it is one of the best I have ever eaten.\n",
      "Very good experience overall!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My first review on yelp. Only reason I'm doing this review is because of Delmonico's Steakhouse at The Venetian. We were tired of the average buffets and fast food and we really wanted to have a fancy night. So we looked up on yelp for a nice fancy restaurant. We decided on Delmonico's and called in to make reservations for two at 530. Came 530, we were still at the pool, so we called in and pushed the reservation to 630. Staff accommodated us, which was surprising. We came to restaurant at 630 and were seated immediately. The staff are on the dot with their reservations. Right after we were seated, the waiter asked what we would like to drink. I ordered a usual neat Johnny Walker Black Label and followed it with a 7&7. I believe every man should learn to love whiskey. My lady ordered a water lol. We then looked at the menu. I read all the reviews on yelp and just jumped straight to the assortment of steaks they had available. My lady ordered a New York T Bone Steak and I had the filet mignon. We also ordered the Butternut squash ravioli for the appetizer and mashed potatoes to eat with the steaks. \n",
      "\n",
      "First came ravioli. It was 5 pieces of ravioli. My first thought was,\"Damn I'm getting jipped out of 15 bucks\" But when I bit into the first piece of ravioli, I literally had an mouth orgasm... No homo. It was the best ravioli I ever had in my life. Hands down. I wish I had a whole plate full of it. My lady was hella impressed as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then came out the steaks. I hade mine cooked medium rare and she had hers done medium. The first bite was the best. Succulent, tender, easy to chew. Best steak I ever had in my life.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Went to Emril's Delmonico last night for dinner and to sum up the experience was grossly underwhelmed from start to finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Atmosphere: the general atmosphere and ambiance is exactly what you'd expect from a fine-dining Casino restaurant. Clean and well-kept. \n",
      "\n",
      "Service: The service was generally pretty good from the two support staff assisting our primary server. Our main server, however, was quite underwhelming to say the least. It was apparent from the moment he greeted us that he wasn't enthused to have a 2 top sit down (at a table for 2 no less). I mentioned to the server that I was interested in an appetizer to share, but didn't want something so large as to prevent me from fully enjoying the steak I had decided on. He ignored my question for a suggestion. I've never had that happen, anywhere, let alone a fine-dining establishment. The worst part, however, came to the bill. To set the stage, we were seated adjacent to two other 2-top tables, one of which was behind us in the meal progression, the other who was ahead of us. Several moments after our dessert and after dinner-drinks were dropped off, our bill was placed on our table with the statement \"I'll take this as soon as you are ready.\" Interesting . . . I looked at the table next to us, who had already finished dessert and they did not have their bill yet. And on top of that, he failed to ask us if we wanted anything else, which had he asked, he would have realized that my wife would have liked more hot water for her tea. My wife was also thoroughly irritated with the fact that the bill was explicitly placed within my reach, and not hers. She made it a point to the server that she was the one who wished to pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food: We were both completely and 100% underwhelmed with everything we ordered. I had the \"house special\" which was a dry aged, bone-in ribeye, reportedly seasoned with Emril's Essence. It was a good steak. Not great by any means, and most certainly not worth the $52 price tag. The flavor was mediocre (surprising since its purportedly dry-aged), and the cook highly inconsistent. It was ordered medium rare, and parts were rare, others were medium. Very disappointing and suggestive of an amateur grill chef. I'm quite content to pay that much and far more for a good steak, however, I expect to get what I pay for, and this was most certainly not it. I've had far superior steaks for less than 1/2 that price.  My wife ordered the snapper, and it was so overcooked that it was mostly inedible. Also had the mushroom side, which was generally pretty good.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dessert, however, was quite good. The banana creme pie.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps we went on an off night, however, this experience coupled with the abundance of other restaurants on the strip, is enough for me to never return.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Meh. Just .. meh. For the price we paid, I expected better food, and better service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although my steak was cooked properly, my husband's steak was not. The service was slow and not especially friendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, save your money - you can get better steak, better service, and better drinks at Ruth's Chris.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Very impressed!  We made reservations for my wife's birthday dinner & couldn't have been happier.  We shared the Chateaubriand & the filet was cooked to perfection with an amazing flavor.  The crust on the steak was perfect.  The service was fantastic & the ambience was very quiet & private.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I took my wife here for our anniversary last year. The service was outstanding (I think we had three waiters just for our table) and the food was excellent. I had the sea bass and she had the pork chops, both were cooked perfectly and tasted wonderful. For desert they had root beer ice cream and I swear it felt like it was carbonated. The decor was OK but they could do a little more.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Love, Love, Love Delmonico's.\n",
      "My husband and I eat here every time we visit Vegas.  The service has always been consistently great-call you by name, never a water glass left half full, and servers who know and understand the menu.  The food, well, that's what really keeps us going back.  Last visit, we had the Chateaubriand for 2-it was perfect.  The sides that came with were delicious and we had the beer/cheese dip with pretzel bread for a starter and it was heaven in a bowl.  I like the wine selection-our server paired our steak with an appropriate red-not too full, but not too sweet , either.  I also love that they've always sent out an amuse-bouche(a nice, little bite) from the chef before you order-it's the little things that add up!\n",
      "Emeril-you've done it right again!\n",
      "We're going to actually try Carnevino, Batali's latest,  on our trip next month for something new, but I know we'll always visit Delmonico's!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Yummy!  Sometimes, all a man needs is a good steak and some...., ummm, never mind about the latter. \n",
      "\n",
      "Emeril knows how to make a good bone in ribeye, and I was not at all disappointed with my choice of restaurant and menu items to officially blow the diet. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had the bone in ribeye (get this!), an asparagus side with tender and perfectly prepared spears and a truly unique appetizer - fried polenta with seared ahi tuna, a red(ish) sauce, and arugula pesto with super fresh cole (cabbage?, Mustard?Broccoli? - not sure which ) vegetable sprouts sprinkled on top. \n",
      "\n",
      "The overall effect was - 'win!'.   Eat here.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I was a bit skeptical as usual to try a tv chef place, such as Emeril. But i wasn't disappointed after all. We started the evening with a pre drink at the bar which is a small but nice and up scale place. Then we both ordered starter and main course. I had the oyster platter and my friend and the shrimp bbq. The oyster were great, especially because it is the small size ones, more flavorful to me. I think the big hit was the shrimp which takes about 12 hours to make that special bbq sauce. Then we were recommended to try to the bone in ribeye as far as steak. We were going there for steaks to start with but this was definitely a hit. Steak was perfectly cooked, dry aged (8 weeks i think) and we had a lovely potato gratin to complement that. I wasn't a big fan of the corn side dish we ordered though. The waiter also suggested a nice red wine to complement that. Service was top notch with 3-4 servers always around you which is very appreciable. If you are in a mood for steak, i think this is one of the best option in Vegas for sure.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Fantastic food, great wine and amazing service, what more can you ask for. Frank, our server, was top notch, knowledgeable and friendly. Steaks were exceptional and don't miss the BBQ shrimp appetizer.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Pros:\n",
      "1. Was at a chefs table overlooking the kitchen shielded though\n",
      "2. Excellent all around for 6 people\n",
      "3. Excellent service, our famous chef and two servers\n",
      "4. It was fun for all\n",
      "5 Love the black grilled carrots, very tasty said from the amazon jungle\n",
      "6. I could have rated it 4 1/2 stars, I really enjoyed the evening at LAS\n",
      "7. Deserts were off the chart, an indulgence for all\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "1. Lamb from Colorado was OK, not great it was medium cooked, so it was a little chewy since I prefer medium rare.\n",
      "2. Really none\n",
      "\n",
      " I recommend it highly. Damage was reasonable, we will be back!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The first time I went to this restaurant was in 2002, and I remember it like it was yesterday. It is in the top three meals of my life. After almost 10 years I can still remember the flavors of the table-made Caesar salad, the Angel Hair Pasta with Smoky Mushrooms & Tasso, and the perfect Filet Mignon. Joe and I were dating at the time, now married, and we still talk about that dinner, and went to re-live it a couple years ago to be amazed again.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My boyfriend and I decided to eat one expensive meal in Vegas and chose Delmonico Steakhouse based on the Yelp reviews.  Yelpers know what they are talking about...the food was amazing!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "We made reservations using OpenTable and when we arrived, they seated us towards the back of the restaurant and had already removed the extra 2 chairs at our table.  I was impressed!!  Most of the time, even if you make reservations, the restaurant still has to move the chairs and get the table ready.  Not Delmonico!  They were ready for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered a bottle of white wine (even though I was having steak).  I don't remember what wine we had but it was good, even though it was a cheaper bottle.\n",
      "\n",
      "For dinner, we started with the Caesar salad that they make tableside.  I'm not much of a Caesar salad fan but the boyfriend loves it.  The Caesar salad from Delmonico was amazing!  It tasted so fresh and crisp and the 'homemade' dressing was so good!\n",
      "\n",
      "For entrees, the boyfriend ordered the pork chops and I ordered the filet mignon medallions.  We also shared a side of asparagus.  All of our food was excellent!  \n",
      "\n",
      "Just as an FYI, the pork chops were served with a side of mashed sweet potatoes (which I love!) but that wasn't mentioned on the menu.  The boyfriend kindly gave me the sweet potatoes in exchange for 1/2 of one of my filet medallions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of the medallions, one of the top 5 steaks of my life!  I grew up in Oklahoma on a ranch where we had our own personal meat locker...so for me to say that Delmonico's filet medallions are one of the best I've ever tasted, that's definitely saying something!\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, we were too full for dessert but thoroughly enjoyed our meal at Delmonico.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as a side note, the rolls before dinner are real dinner rolls with yeast!  I hate restaurants that serve dry, crusty rolls.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I'm so sad that my boyfriend and I were foolish enough to eat a huge lunch leaving us unprepared for the awesomeness of this place. We were staying in The Venetian with a group of friends and decided on a good steak dinner. As mentioned, my boyfriend and I were still stuffed from lunch so we went for the Cesar salad for two and each got a potato on the side. The salad was so fresh and delicious, and made right at the table. The potatoes were almost too big but delightful. Everyone at the table had what looked to be an amazing steak, the one bite I stole was heaven.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Let the 5 star rating speak for itself. Absolutely delicious mind blowing steaks served here. The bone-in ribeye was grilled to perfection. Topped with butter. Seriously, could you ask for anything more. I had tears welling up in my eyes it was so good. I was having a moment. Tender beyond belief. The cajun rub did not taste cajun. It tasted like seasoned perfection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent sides and appetizers. Wine list, extensive. Decor wasn't my style but very simple - nothing to write home about. The staff was very attentive, helpful, and courteous. \n",
      "\n",
      "Again. Mind blowing!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We've tried qutie a few steakhouses and restaurants in Las Vegas and I think this is one of our favorite in Vegas.   Their steaks are so much more flavorful, tender, juicy and just cooked perfectly.  We've tried many hyped up ones but they fail to meet our expectations. with Demonico, we were not disappointed at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "this is off topic but since we are talking about steakhouses, stay away from \"the cut\" restaurant at palazzo, not good, not worth it. see my review on it if you need to.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Amazing...best steak ever.  Had the bone in ribeye and was outstanding.  Service was excellent, food was pricey but worth it.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Beyond food coma...it's food paralysis!  The itis ain't got nothin' on this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had my preconceptions of the food here but I put them away for a short time and figured I'll try anything once.  Dinner started with some bread with butter and munched on the truffle and parmesan potato chips.  They were very oily, warm, crunchy, savory, and tangy in flavor.  We did not make a dent in them.  The appetizer was soon followed by the lobster bisque and traditional New Orleans gumbo with chicken and andouille sausage.  The lobster bisque was really intense in flavor.  It had an almost bitter flavor but so rich like condensed sweet buttery lobster in sea water.\n",
      "\n",
      "The protein that night was the bone-in ribeye which we split.  Perfectly cooked to medium, it had a nice crust on the outside and had a big glob of butter on top.  I immediately scraped the butter off and put it on the side but a lot of it had already melted onto the plate or penetrated the meat.  The meat was thick, tender, juicy, had perfect grill marks on the outside, and smelled floral due to the either rosemary or thyme sprigs.  Accompanying the main dish was the seared foie gras.  Yes, I had to try the duck (or goose) liver.  It was indeed buttery, silky, melt in your mouth tender and a good sized piece at that.  Like everything else here, it was seared in butter and had a salty, buttery crust to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the sides, we had sauteed garlic wild mushrooms and the creamed corn gratinee.  The mushrooms were delightful.  I loved forking up different varieties that I had no idea what they were.  They just tasted great.  The garlicky, buttery flavor and tender yet almost slippery texture makes this dish my favorite of the night.  The creamed corn also exhibited buttery flavor so much I think it was in a bath of butter and heavy cream.\n",
      "\n",
      "You couldn't have all this great food without wine and they have an impressive wine menu indeed.  I went with that I know and got the syrah.  Toward the end of the meal it hit me.  The wall...of carbs, butter, salt, cholesterol, all in a sluggish soup coursing though my veins like molasses.  I feel my heart straining to pump the blood with heavy thumps and I feel the arteries of my wrist bumping against the table.  My body starts to get lethargic - I don't wanna move, no I can't move - as I gaze blankly over the huge leftovers of corn and butter.  This is beyond food coma, I need a blood transfusion I thought.  Need I be more dramatic?  My preconceptions were right.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the bright side, the service is impeccable here and everyone seems to to take their job seriously and sincerely.  It is a bit of a formal atmosphere but you don't feel like you're in Las Vegas for the short time you're there.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I gave myself a few days before I wrote this review, to see if all the money I dropped on this dinner would be worth it. I've never spent so much on a dinner before, and so even with the glowing Yelp reviews, I went into this a little uneasy.\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend had paid for most of our Vegas trip, so I wanted to treat him to something special. This most definitely was.\n",
      "\n",
      "We made reservations that morning (Thursday, so probably a slow night) for 7 pm. We arrived and were quickly seated. The decor was understated, with muted beige walls and plush brown leather chairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was impeccable. We had three waiters taking care of us! Water glasses never got more than half empty, and they were always ready to please. I asked where the women's room was, and the waiter led me there instead of just giving me directions. I really appreciated that, since the bathrooms were hidden away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lovely bathrooms though, but I expected that. A nice touch for the ladies was a basket of feminine supplies provided in case of emergency,\n",
      "\n",
      "But now, to the main attraction: the food. Oh dear God, the food. We started with the truffle parmesan potato chips. So simple, but sooooo good.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got a rare filet mignon and the boyfriend got the bone-in rib eye medium rare. We got just one side, the cheddar bacon grits. They were good, but could have used more bacon. Then again, I think everything could use more bacon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The meat was... quite literally the best I ever had. I love my steaks bloody, but my plate was clean until I cut into the steak. Chalk that up to a good sear and the excellent crust from the rub they use. It was kinda Cajun-y, but didn't overpower the glorious meat. It was allowed to prove itself as is and it was worth every penny.\n",
      "\n",
      "We surprisingly still had room, so we went for dessert. I went for my old standby, the creme brulee. The boyfriend was intrigued by the root beer float with sarsaparilla sorbet. \n",
      "\n",
      "Can't screw up creme brulee, so no complaints. The sugar crust was thicker than expected, but the sweetness was offset by the chocolate shortbread cookies that came with it. Chocolatey, but not sweet. I could snack on them all day.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the root beer float was a work of art. Came to the table in one of those tall sundae glasses, with the sarsaparilla sorbet on the bottom and vanilla ice cream on top. Waiter poured the bottle of root beer and left the rest for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend is a root beer connoisseur. He used to make his own, so he knows his root beer. And he is still going crazy over that float. I think that speaks for itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "So while at first I might have been apprehensive, I'm really glad we came here. It's out of our budget to do again anytime soon, but I definitely won't forget it.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Dined there last weekend with some friends and we were utterly disappointed. Not impressed one bit.\n",
      "I don't understand how this restaurant received such high ratings, but I certainly would not go back nor would I recommend to anyone.\n",
      "From the food, the service, the ambiance - huge let down.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would've given this place an additional star if the service wasn't so terrible.  The server was slow and was more interested in chatting.  Also, we waited at least 30 min to get our entrees(they didn't even seem busy). \n",
      "After our table was cleared from apps and salads, we waited 20+ min before calling our server to check up on our food. She said it was still within the \"window\" and she couldn't do anything. Luckily, she spoke to her manager after another 5-10 min because that's when our food was \"officially late.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "What we had (from what I can recall):\n",
      "BBQ Shrimp - shrimps were cooked unevenly and drowned in mediocre BBQ sauce. Some were cooked well, but mine was under. \n",
      "Vine-Ripened Tomato Salad - nothing special\n",
      "Baked Crab Stuffed Lobster - lobster tail cooked well, but tough to eat and nothing amazing\n",
      "NY Strip - no flavor\n",
      "Filet - nice crust from the Essence stuff\n",
      "Sauteed Garlic Mushrooms - standard\n",
      "Potato Gratin - bit on the dry side\n",
      "Creamed Corn Gratin - best side order we had on the table, but that doesn't mean much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dessert:\n",
      "Sorbet, banana cream pie, apple fritters, key lime pie.\n",
      "The desserts and our bottle of wine were probably the highlight of this dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are looking for a good steakhouse on the strip, this is NOT the place.\n",
      "You'll probably have better luck at Mastro's, Stripsteak, Prime, or Craftsteak.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This was the steakhouse we decided to grub after my half marathon on the strip. I was concerned that my race attire didn't suit the ambiance and when we entered, we were welcomed. COOL! \n",
      "\n",
      "The staff was outstanding and very informative of the menu. We were led to a private corner booth which made our dinner even more special. We were offered menus and an iPad for our wine selections. I ordered a champagne to celebrate my last race of the year, and the fiancee ordered a glass of Justin cab (one of his faves).\n",

      "Steaks had a great rub on it and was topped with butter. YUP butter... Because I had the rib-eye, there was a lot of fat! YUM!!! I was only able to eat half my steak since it was so huge!!! The fiancee finished his NY. The potato was average and came with all the fixings on the side. I just wanted extra butter. Dinner was great.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dessert was a bit disappointing. We ordered the duck egg creme brûlée since it was unique and highly recommended. At first the dessert was good, but after eating a couple more bites, the dessert started tasting a bit funny. It was so rich and I think the weird taste was getting to our tastebuds! Too bad there wasn't a molten lava cake!\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Over-rated!!!!!!!!! My steak was overly seasoned. It was way too salty for my liking. Everyone else at my table was completely disappointed with their order as well. Not worth wasting your time here.\n",

      "Top notch steak house with incredible care taken in the preparation and display of the dishes.  The chateaubriand is outstanding and the sides were all very amazing including the creamed corn and perfectly cooked asparagus.  Don't forget to try the banana cream pie (it's quite large so you may want to split it)!\n",

      "\n",

      "We had wonderful wine with our meal and great inspiring conversations...it was really refreshing to be out to dinner with people who actually enjoy going out to dinner for 3 hours.

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I love fine dining and this place exceeds expectations. Went for my birthday, boyfriend and I had the truffle potato chips, amazing. Could have ate like 5 orders of them they were so good. I ordered wagyu fillet. Best steak I have. Flavor amazing, melted in your mouth and was just insanely good. Bf got the strip I think...? Or ribeye haha don't remember but whatever it was it was great too. We had twice baked potatoes, great. And the duck egg crème brûlée, great except the sugar was a little too hard and tasted a little burnt in spots but that's the only complaint. The service was beyond amazing too. So attentive and very nice. Will be coming back here often\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I am pretty critical when it comes to steak.  After sinking my teeth into my first pricey steak years ago.. I instantly understood why people pay top dollar for delicious cow.\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We decided to give Delmonico's a try because we had received a special notification through American Express. I had been to Delmonico's in New Orleans many years ago and my Hubby and I frequented Emeril's in Orlando when we lived in Tampa. We were not disappointed!! I had requested a romantic booth and that's exactly where we were seated!! This experience was wonderful and memorable! For starters, our wait staff was Amazing! Kudos to Mark, Dan and Tyke. We started with the Carpaccio and Green Salad - both fresh and delicious! I ordered a special Ribeye that was not on the menu that Mark told me about. Divine! Hubby got the Japanese Waygu and said it was the most tender Ribeye he had ever eaten! For wine, we opted for a 1/2 bottle of a 2007 Chateauneuf-du-Pape that was perfect for our entrees. For dessert, we got the Chocolate Decadence Cake that was delicious! The only negative was the Pistachio Ice Cream had shells in the first bite. The Manager was summoned and the dessert was taken off the bill and he offered us the choice of another dessert which we declined. Overall, a wonderful dining experience and we would gladly return!!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Excellent food and service. The only thing I did not love was the egg on my Wilted Spinach & Frisée salad. It was poached and then coated with bread crumbs and fried which cooked the yolk completly. Not good on this type of salad. Try the creamed corn it is delicious.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] If you're looking for good steak, you go to Delmonico.\n",

      "This place is classy as hell and I loved it. The waiter was very nice and knowledgeable and a funny guy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bone in ribeye was perfect. Medium rare, juice oozed out, flavor exploded. Exactly what you want. The grits were good too, but the cheesy potato side was a standout.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a hair in our dessert and our waiter brought over the manager, comped the dessert and gave us another dessert on top of that! The caramel cake and the creme brûlée were good ways to end the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, I want to live in the steak.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My very favorite steak. It would be my last meal on earth if served with a well aged cab.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I really liked Delmonico.  It's a bit pricey, but not unusual given the quality and location in the Venetian.  I especially loved the lobster bisque - definitely try it.  The Ahi Tuna Tartar was pretty good, but not a must get.  My friend and I shared the Chateaubriand filet, which was perfectly done and delicious.  Highly recommended!  \n",

      "And, as icing on the cake, they have an incredible scotch list.  \n",

      "They are able to accommodate large groups, which is nice - but even with a reservation, our wait was an hour, which is unacceptable - minus one star.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've grown to like Vegas more and more as I've learned that they have something for everyone - great food, shows, clubs, gambling, outdoor activities, pools, shopping, etc.  Delmonico is a great addition to the already outstanding food selection in Vegas.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The wife wanted to go to a celebrity chef restaurant so I decided on this place from a past good experience. We had a real good time. \n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] By far the best restaurant on the Las Vegas strip. An overall great dining experience. From the appetizers,salads, and dinner was amazing. The filet mignon was cooked to perfection and the smashed potatoes were delicious. I enjoy eating at DelMonico  whenever I come into town. The staff is friendly, helpful and courteous.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] was in vegas for a wedding & did the fancy/smancy thing cuz i love to eat...big fan of the food network & this guys antics on tv...but this place was horrid & over priced~it fits the picture of u receiving a small piece of the main course & paying like $50/plate wit no sides~calamari was watered down...trus me im all about payin the big bucs if its quality....this one wasnt....this was the only party pooper of the sin city trip\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I don't know what everyone else's problem is. This was by far the best place I have ever been to. Steak was great, server described the seasoning and cooking process and it was on point. She also told us what was good and what was just average. Very knowledgable waitress. Drinks were solid. If you don't eat here you are missing out. Well worth the price.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] A lovely date spot but otherwise I'd worry it feels slightly too formal/buttoned up for my ideal night out in Vegas - food was pleasant, wait staff was really pro and the banana cream pie is the best I have ever had by a mile\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The Ben:  This is my steakhouse when I'm in Las Vegas. Why?  Well, I usually stay in the Palazzo, but they have some pretty amazing steaks.  They start you off with these fresh out of the oven dinner rolls that you can never get enough of, but watch out that you don't fill up on it.  The steaks are worth skipping some bread for.  I always go with the aged prime ribeye on the bone.   It never disappoints and this time since there is a ban of foie gras in Cali I opted to try it for the first time as a topper.  Please don't mock me for never trying the foie, well I can you can, but as a Yelper/foodie I had to try it for my street cred.  I thought it was okay, I just I'm not as much as a foodie as everybody else.  It was just some extra fat for my steak.  I would recommend the banana cream pie for dessert, it was amazing!  Bravo!\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bad:  Only thing I would say it that you will be having a slow dinner.  I think we were there for a few hours.\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] came here with a group of 16 for the fiance's 30th birthday weekend -- 14 adults plus 2 little kiddos (ages 4 and 6).  the service was outstanding!!!  our group of 16 had to be split into 2 circular tables next to each other which made it really difficult to socialize w/each other.  however i really really appreciated how attentive the waiters were, and they treated my little nephews really well too.  i was pleasantly surprised when they offered the boys kids meals consisting of grilled cheese sandwiches and french fries :)\n",
      "\n",
      "now...for the food review.  first off i must clarify, i do not eat beef so my review is for the lamb chop.  lamb is usually a gamble for me because i only like it if its cooked right and does not smell lamb-ey.  my lamb chop was ehhhh.  the meat portion was HUGE, but only the outside was tasty.  the entire inside of my meal was verrrrry gamey -- which i do not like.  we ordered the creamed spinach, potatoes, and mushrooms to share.  they tasted like --- creamed spinach, potatoes, and mushrooms.  really nothing special.  everyone else seemed to enjoy their steaks, but if there's a next time maybe i'll try the pork chop instead.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Lets start with the fact that I pretty much have given up on fancy corporate owned pretentious restaurants years ago.  I prefer the owner operated versions where you can get top notch ingredients cooked expertly with love and care.  Isn't that what we really want when we dine out? In my case, yep. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have been to several of Emerils restaurants in NOLA as well as the one in the MGM, and this was one fine, and to my surprise, a very fun expierence as well. From the time we walked in we had a hilarious encounter with the hostess.  She informed us that it was an hour wait for the dining room.  We didnt want to wait that long so she offered us the option of sitting at the bar.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, glanced over and observed a 60ish man and a bouffant haired woman sitting towards the end of the bar, a couple of empty seats to their left, but that was busy with a crowd of men milling about. I jokingly said to the hostess that was not a bad option, but that lady looked like the type that would be doused in perfume which would be a bit of a palate buzz kill. She stated that she was sensitive to that as she was allergic to perfume. I, again joking, suggested she stroll by and test the air. \n",
      "\n",
      "She immediately walked towards the lady doing a perfect \"whistle past the graveyard\" stroll and raised her nose to the heavens as she passed the suspect. It was absolutely hilarous. Guess we couldnt leave after that, damn glad we stayed. \n",
      "\n",
      "The other reviewers have already testified re; the awesome food, I definetly concur, but wanted to yelp about the personality of some of the staff. Oh, our bartendress/server was a joy as well.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I rarely write reviews, even though I rely on Yelp VERY heavily for my restaurant selections! It's usually just because nothing overwhelmed me, or I was too lazy to do so - I'm trying to be better about that! My husband and I went to Las Vegas last week for our first year anniversary to get a way for a few days. We always try and scout out new restaurants. This was definitely our favorite meal - hands down! The entire experience was great -- they brought out a small treat for us to start, then we both had amazing bourbon cocktails, and then dove into the delicious food. I got the Filet Mignon, but prepared Piedmontese style which is just seasoning, olive oil, roasted garlic, and rosemary - it was cooked perfectly (medium) and super tender and had great flavoring. It didn't need any sauce! My husband got the bone-in ribeye which they are known for I believe - I had a few bites and it was fantastic. The au gratin potatoes were also good and not overly heavy like some can be. Our wine was great as well, Stag's Leap. The BEST part of the experience though was our waiter Rene. He was so attentive, fun to talk to, and just wanted us to enjoy ourselves. He really made this experience special. I also have some dietary restrictions and I've never seen a restaurant be so attentive to them. It really put me at ease. Next time you're in Vegas, GO HERE. We'll be returning for New Year's this year and have already recommended it to some friends going out later this month!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We came here for our one year anniversary dinner.   I was a little intimidated to eat at a place like this in Vegas but once we were seated everyone was super nice and didn't make us feel like we shouldn't be there.   \n",
      "\n",
      "The menu has a bunch of different things on it but the star of the show (as told by my waitress) is the beef.   Husband and I knew we were both going to order steak before we even looked at the menu.   \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the ribeye with country smashed potatoes and husband got the filet mignon with creamed corn.   The side were served family style and were more than enough for two people.   The creamed corn was fantastic.  It had little bits of jalapeno in it for the extra BAM!  \n",
      "\n",
      "We both ordered the lobster bisque to start.   Bisque was very delicious especially the lumps of lobster meat.   Did you know during the summer the bisque is dairy free?  \n",
      "\n",
      "The steaks were just okay.  Asked for mine medium but it came out well done so I didn't find it that good.  Husband also asked for medium but basically got a rare steak.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall though the atmosphere was definitely upscale yet comfortable.  I want to compliment our waitress ...she was very friendly and fun.   Check was $164 dollars for two people.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Besides having to finance your meal with a 20% deposit, this is the best steak and lamb my wife and I have ever had. The filet Mignon was ridiculously tender and perfectly seasoned. You do not have to put any salt or pepper on anything. The lamb was even better and the portions were huge (9 oz filet and 2 lamb racks). We started with a lump crab cake which had a dill caper sauce that was AMAZING. To give you an idea of what we spent, we got an appetizer (crab cake), two cocktails, filet mignon, lamb with truffle oil, side of potatoes (everything is al a carte so sides you get separately family style) was $150 without tip. Expensive I know, but I guess that's Vegas; $6 waters, and $100 market price lobster. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only downside is that this place is LOUD!!! The way the ceilings and the rooms are built noise just bounces around so if you are looking for a quiet romantic dinner, I wouldn't go here. If you are looking for the best steak of your life, this is a great place. \n",
      "\n",
      "A couple rounds of blackjack might help you pay for you meal. I probably wouldn't eat here again... at least until I save up over next 30 years. Good luck! :)\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Really a top-flight dining experience, and my favorite Vegas steakhouse. The food is terrific, the room is dignified and the service is what really takes it over the top. The staff here are true professionals and it shows. Very impressive. \n",
      "\n",
      "No, it isn't cheap but then again, is any good Vegas restaurant? Sometimes you get what you pay for, and at Delmonico you get a terrific, classy dining experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only disappointment: they no longer offer their New Orleans version of Oysters Rockefeller, which was one of my favorite appetizers anywhere. Our waiter told me they could make it happen next time if I call ahead and ask. I just might do that, and I'll definitely be back.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Not too fond of the atmosphere but the food and service was great.  I have to say that the bone in rib eye I had here years ago reigned for many years as champion, the very best steak I've ever had in my entire life until last year when that title was taken from Emeril Legasi by Tom Colicchio at his restaurant Craft Steakhouse.  So Delmonico is one of my all time favorite steak joints.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Amazing steak dinner for Valentine's Day! Amazing service and phenomenal food! We would definitely come back!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Appetizer: Ahi!\n",
      "Entree: Bone-in ribeye!\n",
      "\n",
      "Really recommend this place if you want something decent in Vegas.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We were at DelMonico's last year to celebrate my boyfriend's sister's 21st birthday. That meant there were A LOT of us! The atmosphere was awesome, but then again, every restaurant in Vegas has some degree of nice ambiance, right? Anyhow, our large party wasn't able to sit together, which really sucked because we had made reservations and they expected all of us at that time. So, my boyfriend, me and his two cousins got our own mini-table. We all shared the caesar salad prepared table-side. It was seriously enough for all 4 of us, and it was very very delicious. I ordered the gumbo, and was very disappointed. I thought that gumbo would be Emeril's thing! It was slightly cold and WAY too salty. It was a nice little presentation though-- it came in a mini-pot and was poured into my bowl. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had the filet mignon and it was okay, and I wish I had ordered the duck. I can't really say why I only thought the filet mignon was only okay, but maybe it had to do with the fact that it was pretty salty too and I had just finished up a super salty gumbo? \n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, it was a fun experience because of the atmosphere and because all of the family was there. Would we have had just a good of a time had we gone somewhere else? Probably. But, this was birthday girl's choice and it was kinda fun to go to a celebrity chef's place and criticize their food. :)\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Hands down, the best steak I've had.\n",
      "We were staying at Palazzo, and decided to eat at the hotel on our first night.\n",
      "The restaurant had plenty of seats and we were seated right away as we walked in.\n",
      "We shared a salad and a side of sauteed mushrooms, I had their filet mignon, and boyfriend had the ribeye. EVERYTHING including the mushrooms were memorable, and we weren't even that hungry when we walked in. I wish Emeril would open one in San Francisco, so we can go back on our special occasions more conveniently.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We had lunch at Delmonico Steakhouse in the Venetian on Saturday. When we arrived around 1:15 PM there were only two other tables occupied by diners, so we got plenty of attention from Adriana, who was very professional and helped to create a wonderful lunch experience for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "As starters we ordered the Buttered Fresh Asparagus and Sauteed Wild Garlic Mushrooms The asparagus was delicious and the mushrooms were simply incredible. If you are a garlic lover you must try these mushrooms; we are and we believe we would make a return trip to the Delmonico just to order these again.\n",
      "\n",
      "We then split a Grilled Skirt Steak Sandwich which featured wonderfully marinated, expertly cooked steak with a horseradish mayo that perfectly complemented the meat. The sandwich was outstanding, and there was no extra charge for splitting it and serving us each half on own own plate. \n",
      "\n",
      "We then decided to go for it and split a piece of Emeril's famous Banana Cream Pie. This turned out to be not your ordinary banana cream pie in that there seemed to be no cream filling with the bananas. It looked like a vast number of differently shaped banana slices had been stacked on the crust in a kind of patchwork design, and yet they had done something to these bananas to make them deliciously sweet. There was a substantial amount of whipped cream on top of the slice which had been dusted with chocolate and drizzled with caramel. This pie was definitely a winner, and we regretted that we had no more room to sample some of their other desserts. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are already planning a return visit to Delmonico Steakhouse next time we are in Vegas to further explore their menu and other items. Based on our lunch experience there we know we will be in for some fabulous flavors.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I went to Vegas most recently having made reservations at Delmonico ahead of time.  This is my 6th Emeril restaurant to visit. The French style of serving is charming, as always, and the management at this location were eager to please.  We felt a bit rushed at the beginning when our salads arrived seemingly almost immediately after we ordered, but they slowed the pace at our request so that we could savor the experience.  Neither of us were disappointed in our food, and the dessert was quite good.  The barbeque shrimp, if you've never had it, is definitely worth ordering.  But nothing left us talking about it afterword...  \n",
      "While Delmonico is not going to leave you hungry, it may not leave you marveling, either.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] A-okay! Was at this restaurant this past Saturday for a bday dinner. \n",
      "\n",
      "The atmosphere was cool and what you'd expect from a high end steakhouse. However it is located in the Venetian hotel which has seriously gone downhill from the last time I was there (maybe '05-'06).\n",
      "\n",
      "Service was great, and friendly too. However the food was ehhh, on the border of \"ok.\" I ordered a filet cooked medium, but I got well (even burnt along edges). My bf ordered the ribeye cooked medium, and he got a true medium - a little pink inside, nicely cooked outside & edges. Our table shared mushrooms (wouldn't recommend, bland), country mashed and au gratin potatoes (both ok), corn (tasty!), and creamed spinach... Only thing was, we never got it. I think we were so busy eating and talking that we didn't realize it till afterwards. I guess it happens.\n",
      "\n",
      "So all in all, this place is ok. It doesn't rank above the norm, nor would I drag it down... It's a middle of the road type steakhouse. With so many amazing options in Las Vegas, I'd recommend you try another one before here (STK, Chef Ramsey's).\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My wife & I dined here while we were in Vegas for a conference. With so many places to choose from we decided on Delmonico because it was in our hotel & we figured we couldn't go wrong at one of Emeril's restaurants. The dining area was very spacious & well decorated. The staff was very friendly and attentive to all our needs. I started with the wedge salad which was excellent. The bacon had a great smokey flavor & was crispy. The blue cheese was some of the best I ever had. My wife had the lobster bisque which was excellent as well. We the decided to try the Chateaubriand dinner for 2 which came with garlic mashed potatoes & asparagus. The meal is brought out and the meat is served table side. We ordered it medium rare & it was perfect for me. It had excellent flavor and was extremely tender. My wife would have preferred it to be a little more cooked in the center but she ate the outer pieces which for a little more well down but still tender & tasty. The potatoes & asparagus were both  perfectly cooked with great flavor. We passed on dessert because we were too full to eat anything else. I would highly recommend this restaurant & would eat there again when in Vegas!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I had the best meal of my life here. I'm not even kidding. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was five years ago when I was on my honeymoon, and the memory of that meal is still with me. I had the petite filet, which came with a side of blue crab hollandaise risotto. Unfortunately, it's not on the menu anymore. The hubs had the ribeye and said it was the best steak he'd ever eaten. We split a bottle of wine. Dinner was pricey, but so worth it. We probably never would have gone here except some considerate wedding guests went in together and got us a gift certificate. The waitress was SO nice, despite us being completely out of our element. This place is super fancy, and we are more of the bar and grill-type frequenters. Also, when we called and made a reservation, we told them we were on our honeymoon. They brought us a mini-appetizer on the house and congratulated us, which was a nice touch.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Delmonico lives up to its reputation (and prices). A true fine dining experience. Service was attentive and helpful. Bbq shrimp are a New Orleans classic and you should try them if you never have. Bone in ribeye was one of the best steaks I have ever had. The duck special was also very expertly prepared.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] A really great steak house. I've been told they have other things on the menu but I can never pull myself away from their steaks. If you love a good steak (I've heard the other food is very good too) then this is THE place in Vegas. The atmosphere is classy but relaxed. You can feel comfortable in jeans. It's pricey - it's Vegas. The service is very good to excellent. I wouldn't recommend this place for small children. And who cares about parking? It's Vegas, baby!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Very greasy, lackluster food. Had a conference lunch and my ravioli was swimming in oil. Maybe they were too overwhelmed with the crowds of people. Waiter was very nice. Bar section was nicely designed.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Hands down the best steak I've ever had. \n",
      "\n",
      "What an absolutely memorable experience from start to finish and a complete slam dunk on the three foodie tenets: food, service and ambiance. \n",

      "Our waiter, Frank, was friendly, hilarious and beyond helpful. His recommendations just simply rocked. The ambiance was spacious, open, modern and comfortably cozy - the dining area is huge and perfect for large group dinners. We stayed at the Palazzo so it was a convenient location to head to since its in the heart of the Venetian. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now here are the juicy deets on the food: \n",
      "1. Tomato Bisque soup with a dollop of cream: OH MY GOODNESS. So creamy and absolutely delicious\n",
      "2. Filet of beef medallions: The juiciest and most tender pieces of beef you'll ever find topped with mushrooms & bread crumbs, apple bacon, parmesan cheese and a special home made sauce *insert tears of happiness* \n",
      "3. Delmonico's prime hamburger: Oh my oh my. Served on a toasted brioche roll with cheddar cheese and bacon and accompanied by a bed of fries... this burger is unlike your average joe one. It's hearty, juicy, tender and foodgasmic. Do yourselves a major favor and include this as one of your entrees. \n",
      "4. Emeril's banana cream pie: After all of the steak and appetizers, my stomach was literally about to burst from fullness. However, at the taste of this pie, I was somehow able to stretch my pants to new heights and devour the whole pie. Thank goodness my bf and I ordered our own desserts because he just wouldn't have gotten any otherwise. \n",
      "5. The pinot noir I ordered was the perfect complement to all of the above, taking my palette to new extremes. Unfortunately, I can't remember the name, but I do remember that it was from Sonoma and I ordered it by the glass. \n",
      "\n",
      "We also had the lobster bisque and the BBQ shrimp as appetizers. While they were phenomenal as well, they were a mere 5 stars in comparison to the 6-7 star dishes above. So basically, you can't lose by ordering anything at Delmonico's. \n",
      "\n",
      "Happy Eating, Yelpers!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] 4.5 Stars \n",
      "Delmonico does not disappoint! \n",
      "\n",
      "I had the wonderful luck of visiting Delmonico for my birthday dinner in Vegas. I was beside myself with excitement to try an Emeril restaurant! \n",
      "Prior to our 8:30 reservation, we sat in the lounge to take pictures and have a drink. Our hostess came to get us when our table was ready. \n",
      "We were greeted by our friendly waitress (her name escapes me) and were all seated quickly. She took our drink orders and delivered them quickly. She let me peruse the VAST wine list at my leisure and explained the specials of the evening and gave the market price of the items on the menu. \n",
      "\n",
      "I decided on the bone-in rib steak with broccoli and bacon cheddar grits. In the meantime, I ordered a bottle of Klinker Brick Zin and our EVER observant, and discreet waitress whispered in my ear to inquire on the preference on whether I would like her to present the bottle just to me or would I like her to present it to the rest of my drunk and (embarrassingly) rowdy guests. What a professional. I won't even get into how I handled the two of my 4 dinner partners and their TERRIBLE manners, but let's just say I won't be seeing them anymore. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, dinner arrived. My steak was beautiful. Well, cooked, not quite as rare as I had hoped, ah well. A rare steak seems to throw cooks, I don't get it. The sides were HUGE and beautiful. The broccoli was fresh and not over steamed so they still had a slight crunch to them. My bacon and cheddar grits were so rich and savory. I could only have a few bites of them before my stomach couldn't take anymore. Delmonico was nice enough to deliver chocolate ice cream at the end and wish me a happy birthday! What a lovely ending to a chaotic dinner! \n",
      "\n",
      "I hope to enjoy Delmonico again soon, and with better dinner partners!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I had the bone in ribeye with twice baked potato and roasted mushrooms. The steak was big and the sides were fantastic. My mother ordered a medium rare NY strip but It came out medium well. If we were not in a rush we would have said something and I'm sure they would have taken care of it. Overall very nice place to eat. Well worth the price.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Fantastic meal. Great price on the summer three course special. I would definitely come back here. Great service as well.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Amazing restaurant. Lets start off by saying really goood waiter. Portions were big and very tasty aswell. Will definitely  be coming back\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This was my first trip to Vegas...ever.  I know, how can that be after 31 years of age and my love for everything naughty?  Nevertheless, I wanted to have one memorable, fantastic dinner while there.  After consulting with a few friends and reading fellow yelpers reviews we decided on Delmonico Steakhouse at the Venetian.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I was able to make our reservation online about two months in advance (same time I booked the trip).  It was so easy I would definitely recommend it to ensure you will have a table ready and waiting for you.  Second, because Mr. Vivi and I were killing it at the Blackjack table at the Mandalay...we were about 15 minutes late for our reservation.  I apologized numerous times when we arrived, and to my relief our table was still ours and the host was super friendly and understanding.  Note:  I don't know if this would fly on a busy Fri or Sat night.\n",
      "\n",
      "To say the service was excellent could be an understatement.  We had our main server, I think his name was Eric (insert free drinks at the aforementioned Blackjack table so his name could have been Bob) and he couldn't be more helpful, polite and efficient.  We also had two other people who were assisting Eric with the service who were great as well.  Eric helped me pick out a glass of red wine that was delicious and didn't make me feel bad for not being the wine connoisseur everyone and their mom thinks they are.  Our drinks were brought to us very quickly and we were off to the food.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I had been perusing the menu for awhile and thought we would go with a full four course meal however, I had no idea how fun the tables would be and didn't want too much food to deter my winnings after dinner.  We opted to skip the appetizer (would have loved to have try the crab cakes or at least the Parmesan potato chips) and went straight to the Cesar salad served table side for two.  If you love Cesar salad please do me a favor and run to this place.  They freaking make the entire thing in front of you, dressing included.  When Eric was finished with my plate I could have clapped I was so happy...in fact I think I did. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we went for the petite medallions with a side of asparagus and a twice baked potato.  Can I say I am in heaven??  This is why I could never be a vegetarian.  The meat was cooked to absolute perfection.  So tender it felt like butter in my mouth.  The asparagus and twice baked potato were both good, but I would definitely try something different next time...there is just too much to chose from.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I knew in advance the bill was going to be somewhat expensive but seriously, it was worth every single penny.  From start to finish the entire experience made me forget I left a table we were up 500 dollars.  \"Ah yeah babe,\" this place is that good and I will be back the next time I visit.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Wonderful pre-show dinner!  We enjoyed the handcrafted cocktails, delicious BBQ shrimp appetizer, bowl of authentic gumbo, perfectly cooked filet mignon with cajun spices, twice cooked baked potato, and a flavorful key lime pie along with a beautiful bottle of Petit Syrah recommended by the sommelier.  The ambiance is nice, the service was impeccible and the location is wonderful!!  Would highly recommend this restaurant and will happily come again!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] delicious! but i was way too full from eating the days before to completely enjoy this place.\n",
      "\n",
      "we started out with calamari and crab cakes. im not that into calamari but i thought the crab cakes were wonderful. the lobster bisque was super rich and creamy. yum. and it comes with what i thought was bread, but when you stir it into the soup, the bread somehow melts into great big chunks of lobster.\n",
      "\n",
      "everybody got steak and i went with the ahi tuna, cuz i figured i could just get a taste of their steak. that didn't really go to plan cuz i just ended up eating everyone else's steak, especially my friend's bone in rib steak (med rare). hehe. but the tuna was still very good.\n",
      "\n",
      "ended dessert with the bread pudding and creme brulee. i liked the bread pudding more because it was hot and it was topped off nicely with ice cream.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] one of the best steaks i've ever had.  amazing waiter, attended to us as if the rest of the restaurant wasn't packed.  having cellars bursting with superb and undrunk wine, my buddies and i BYOBed, and the waiter joined in.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This is solely for the Chef's Table experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bar area, dining room, and professional wait service is on par with spendy steakhouses. The vibe is casual, yet classy and not stuffy or pretentious, but imma talk more about this other thing going on near the kitchen. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to catch a glimpse of the restaurant's inner sanctum, with a backstage-VIP-behind-the-scene view of organized chaos that is a proper kitchen service (and willing to pay for the private room setting), then prepare for a premium dinner. Anyone with an unbent iPhone 6+ can snap selfies and food pics these days, but you need just a little more than reservations for this opportunity. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our group was ushered through the dining room and towards the kitchen door, then guided into a side room that was separated from the dining room area. Glass panels allowed us to see the various kitchen workstations. In this fishbowl room, it was cramped quarters, like dudes crammed into a submarine mess hall, but you kinda just get used to it and settle in for the experience. Battle stations!\n",
      "\n",
      "The food (photos uploaded) was brought in by a team of waiters and chefs and placed in front of us in unison at every course. Each tasting was beautifully plated and delicious. Course after course was brought in, and they even paused mid-service to allow diners to return from their nicotine break before bringing in the next round of plates.\n",
      "\n",
      "After all these dinner courses, there isn't much room left in the tummy for dessert. I was expecting maybe something light and sweet to cleanse the palate. Suddenly, these giant platters of everything from the dessert menu appeared! It wasn't just one or two items. So much decadence and it was a surprisingly wonderful grand finale to a spectacular meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the amount $$$$pent, we could've went for bottle service, made it rain, or get swindled at a rub-n-tug joint, but we indulged on a magical evening of delightful food pr0n. Would go again if I hit a Vegas jackpot.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Do not, I repeat, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO HAVE A STEAK WITHOUT THE FOIE GRAS OPTION. I would belly crawl through glass to have it again. \n",
      "\n",
      "Well not really, but it would make me consider doing it that's for sure.  Awesome place and the scotch pairing I had with the steak was so damn good.  The experience is well worth the pricing, and it to the point at which after the meal I return back to my hotel room and fell asleep on the couch from being so blissfully full.\n",
      "\n",
      "That never happens after a steak, except for the time I came here. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would highly recommend anyone to go here, and remember DO NOT FORGET THE FOIE GRAS!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Nice place. Good steaks, delicious sides, good service. A bit overpriced, but not bad for Vegas. The only problem was with my salad. The egg was overcooked, and when I asked for another, they didn't bring a new salad, just a new egg, which turned out to be overcooked as well. I gave up and started eating the salad anyway, and when I pulled out a long dark curly hair, I stopped. They took the salad away, and three people apologized, but they didn't offer me another appetizer. They did make up for the unconvinced by comping our corkage, dessert, and, of course, the salad. It was a nice way to make up, but we didn't find out about that until the end of the meal.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] By FAR one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.  I have eaten here many times for dinner and was able to have lunch as well.  Lunch was just as good and less expensive here as dinner.  What I love most about this place is the variety on the menu.  It is all typical steakhouse fare but with lots of choices and executed very well.  The typical blue cheese wedge is so decadent with large chunks of cheese and caramelized bacon, all other wedge salads will not do it for you in the future.  The lobster bisque is sweet and creamy and is a must have each time you go.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Important hint: don't pass up dessert - a true quality restaurant will have a well rounded and exciting dessert menu.  Delmonico's never fails.  My favorite is anything chocolate/peanut butter or Baily's Irish cream inspired.  This restaurant always seems to have something like this on their menu.  Desserts are rich, gooey with a multitude of flavor combos.  Just what I like :)\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I didn't come here for the steak...but the fish was just as good! Plus, this was one of the few restaurants that was still seating at like 10pm on a Monday night. \n",
      "\n",
      "A must try is the lobster potato gnocchi appetizer. It is heavenly! I want to order like 5 of these and make it into my entree! The gnocchi is prepared in my favorite way- toasted and a bit crispy on the outside. Yum! And of course, there was a hefty serving of lobster knuckle meat!\n",
      "\n",
      "For my main dish, I had the sturgeon with crab lumps in a lemon butter sauce. Again, I was impressed! Lots of crab meat and everything was full of flavor. I also tried some of the bone-in ribeye, which was huuuuge. If you're super hungry, order a steak from here and you won't be disappointed. For dessert, I had the chocolate bread pudding, which was good...but a bit too rich and chocolate-y. I would've preferred a traditional bread pudding.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should take off one star for the strand of hair I found baked into my bread...but the rest of my meal made up for it, so it didn't bother me too much!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The best part of the whole experience was the service...they paid a lot of attention to our party of four.\n",
      "\n",
      "The worst part were the STEAKS!!!!!!! cold....later warmed up and dry with no taste at all. I can make a much better meal at home!!\n",
      "\n",
      "I would never come back to spend so much money for horrible food.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a duck that was decent but not worth writing home about, sadly :( it was quite dry and all it needed was some of the cane sauce to be poured over it. I wonder if they can cook anything right here when it comes to meat.\n",
      "\n",
      "quite a disappointment, i am never coming back.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Service was pretty good, food was pretty mediocre.  For the price, they get 2/5 stars.  I've had much better food before at this price point, and I've had much better steaks for much less (like the porterhouse at the Applebee's in Rutland, VT, for example).\n",
      "\n",
      "The main dings are from:\n",
      "1.  The steak was overcooked.  No better way to ruin a steak than to overcook it.  I ordered my steak medium-rare and it came out medium-well.  Maybe I shouldn't have assumed that a pricey steak house would always err on the side of raw, because they did the opposite.  To me, a steak that is cooked all the way through but still pink (as opposed to deep uncooked red) and having the same dry texture as well done is a medium-well, not a medium-rare.\n",
      "2.  The sides weren't done well.  The asparagus that we ordered was overcooked (soft and limp to the point that it was hard to pick a piece up with the fork).  The potatoes seemed overdone (the cheese was dried out instead of cheesy).  I do better asparagus at home and you can find better potatoes almost anywhere.  The cream corn w/ cheese was good, but nowhere near as good as the divey korean chicken place back home.\n",
      "\n",
      "They do have a large vine list.  They had a lot of European wines, although I'm not very familiar with them.  I was looking for South American wines.  I was a bit surprised that they had Malbec from Chile, but no Carmenere.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The main upsides are service and atmosphere.  The staff is very precise and they pay attention to little details like putting your napkin back in place when you get up and making sure all the plates arrive at the table simultaneously (although this trick would work better if I didn't see them swarming by the trays next to our table for two minutes trying to orchestrate the exercise for our table of 11).\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, if you're looking more for the atmosphere and experience and care less about the food, check it out.  If you really want a great steak, you may be disappointed.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] i stumbled apon this place my first trip to vegas and been coming back ever since. u can always count on getting a very good meal with some great service.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Went there with co-workers because one of them had a craving for steak. We should've gone to just a whatever steakhouse that you could have for less than $20.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their bone-in steak ran about $48. Their appetizer salad special of the day (which I had as an entree) was $20. Don't believe what the vegas tourist book says. It said it's \"$$\", where in actuality was more like \"$$$$\". I don't think I'd go there again. My friend said his lobster bisque soup was just \"okay\" and not as good as another, less expensive place. He said it was bland and not much flavor to it. Their twice-baked potato was pretty good, but I can imagine how unhealthy it is for you. \n",
      "\n",
      "Their setting is nice though - dimly lit in some parts of the restaurant. Great for couples or dates. And if you want to go there, make sure it's something special like a birthday or anniversary. That's probably the only time I'd go back IF I ever went back.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] What kind of retard spends $60 on a steak? \n",

      "^^^ This kind (noob.yelp.com)\n",
      "\n",
      "             \n",
      "This place is SOOOOOOOOOO good. I have nothing negative to say whatsoever about the food. The restaurant design/ambiance is on point and so are the waiters/waitresses. I like their waiting room (piano, drinks, seats, TVs, and all). \n",
      "\n",
      "Seriously though, I could eat their steak for breakfast, lunch, dinner, AND dessert. That good. Trust.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Disappointing or too high of expectations? \n",
      "\n",
      "When I am spending $50 for a steak (Bone-in Ribeye) which was recommended by the waiter was the best steak on the menu I have particularly high expectations. The dishes are all a la carte so I also ordered a side of Asparagus, Potatoes AuGratin and Garlic Mushrooms. \n",
      "\n",
      "The steak was a large serving (14 oz) but I found it lacked in flavor for my expectations. I have had better steak at high end restaurants....\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] People looking for a steak fix should definitely head over here for a yummy steak. The salad was a absolutely delicious. The mushrooms melted in my mouth and were just so good.\n",
      "My wife and I both had soup as an appetizer, Something this place is very well known for. I had the shrimp gumbo, now that was great gumbo. My wife had the fillet minion and I tried the Cajun Steak which was just so tender and juicy, talk about perfection here.\n",
      "We also had the asparagus, how perfectly cooked.\n",
      "I decided to have a yummy baked potato with my dinner,  butter and sour cream right along with it. Delmonico is by far the best steakhouse I have ever been to in Las Vegas.\n",
      "The waiter  was very friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu. The owner is the great Emeril Lagasse, the guy that yells BAM!!!! on his cooking show. Come here if you want the best steak ever.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Celebrating a friend's birthday last night November 1st everything started out well with our server Drew it went downhill from there when we were asked to move our table in the middle of a eating our appetizers for a party of four boisterous drunk men. when I say move I mean they literally asked our party of 4 to get up moved our table near the wall and pushed two smaller tables together for the party of 4 men. The Apex and Sema Convention were on town so the restaurant was packed. I had a ribeye steak which was good however the baked potato I ordered was cold along with our other sides. I will give credit to the manager who did remove the sides from our bill.  The bone marrow toast did not taste like it had any bone marrow at all and the BBQ shrimp was just ok.    I was very disappointed especially after spending  $388\n",
      "  I wasn't aware the convention was in town or we definitely would have come another night. when your spending that much money on a steak I think the service and meal should be outstanding\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] What better place to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and Yelp Spring Break than in Las Vegas! I wanted to surprise my bf so I made reservations through open table for dinner at Delmonico. When we arrived the hostess wished my bf a happy birthday and we were told to have a seat in the waiting room. Wow that waiting room was super nice but also packed! Lucky for us as we turned around to scan for a seat the hostess called my name and said our table was ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon being seated we were greeted by our server. He also wished my bf happy birthday and took our drink orders. When the waiter returned with our water he also brought some warm, soft, honey rolls the melted in our mouths. We decided to start with the Petite Iceberg Lettuce Wedge salad followed by a Twice Baked Potato ($9) and Rib-eye ($48) for me and Short Rib Special ($35) for my bf. Before our salads came out the waiter brought a small appetizer for us to share- compliments of the chef. I don't remember what exactly it was but it was so delicious!\n",
      "\n",
      "The wedge salad ($13) was composed with petite iceberg lettuce wedges and topped with apple smoked bacon and red onion with buttermilk blue cheese dressing. There was A LOT of crumbled blue cheese on the salad- almost a little too much for me. It was enough for both of us to share and enjoy before we got our steak knifes and forks ready for what was to come next.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish I were hungrier at the time- my rib-eye was HUGE! After the rolls and salad my steak and bf's short rib looked almost impossible to finish and it was quite a challenge. The rib eye was thick, juicy and tender- served with a slice of melting butter on top. Every bite felt so sinful as it tasted so good despite how full I was I couldn't stop indulging in more. I tried my best to eat my half of the twice baked potato. It was really smooth and rich with bacon and Vermont cheddar.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't say much about my bf's short rib since I was too busy trying to finish my ribeye. I know he really enjoyed it and the meat was so tender it fell apart with a light brush from his fork.\n",

      "After dinner the server brought my boyfriend a complementary scoop of banana sorbet for his birthday. He likes bananas but usually doesn't like banana flavored foods. The sorbet was so fresh and smooth he actually really enjoyed it and finished! With a food coma coming on and $115 later we postponed surprise #2 (dessert at Serendipity) and cabbed back to our hotel and called it a night. Who does that in Vegas!?!? \n",

Give the Parmesan Truffle Potato chips a try, you will love them. Lobster Bisque was good as was our steaks.  Side dishes are large so split the order.  The decor is lovely and it was a nice quiet atmosphere. Wish we had room for dessert but maybe next time.  There's definitely lots of places to eat in Vegas but I have to say come to Delmonico Steakhouse. It's well worth every penny.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My Husband took me here for our anniversary dinner. We arrived early at five because we had theatre tickets and had made dinner reservations accordingly.  The restaurant is beautiful with cream walls, rock wood and glass throughout with romantic lighting the evening was looking good. We ordered starters Crab Cakes for my husband nice crispy well seasoned crab I love a crab cake that is more crab then filler and this one was that. I ordered the steak tartar because I've never had it and wanted to be daring. I have to say I was scared lol but it was so worth it. Wonderful crisp toasted baguettes with rich beef capers oil and seasoning and spicy mustard sauce  this has got to be one of the best dishes I've ever eaten and a must try. We then followed this with Lobster bisque  rich warm and creamy with plenty of lobster one of my favorite lobsters bisques definitely.  I had the petite iceberg lettuce wedges a nice take on the classic salad with Wisconsin blue cheese buttermilk dressing homemade apple wood bacon and just the right amount of red onion really tangy. For our entrée we had chosen to go with the  Chateaubriand for two. They carve it tableside and serve it with asparagus and garlic potatoes The sides were actually very good but the meat was just ok nothing special and more red then I care for We had also ordered a side of sautéed garlic wild mushrooms which were also just ok I've had better versions of both these dishes. On to dessert we were bad and ordered two. The Chocolate root beer float which was not that great I guess we just didn't care for the ginger and chocolate flavors together so we didn't finish this one but the banana cream pie was like biting into heaven little shavings of chocolate rich sweet whipped cream bananas and sweet rich caramel sauce make up this dish and it's worth every calorie that's probably packed into it. So splurge and have it it's amazing. The wait staff was amazing making sure you never wanted for anything and that everything went smoothly and the wine selection and service was top notch. Definitely worth the splurge\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I don't usually go to fine dine restaurants while in vegas, but I make a few exceptions and this was one of them. Came here with a few buddies for a birthday. The waiter made our experience a very easy one. He offered many different suggestions and options. After we finally made our decision, the kind gentleman complimented us with bread and such. Afterwards, he poured our glasses with wine and afterwards treated the birthday girl to some lovely dessert. On to the food...\n",
      "\n",
      "At first I was on a budget, but then I said to myself, might as well splurge a little so i ordered the filet mignon and I have to admit, it was deeeeelicious. I did not order any sides with it, and wish i had ordered some sort of baked or mash potatoes. \n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Being a fan of the Food Network and chef Emeril Lagasse, my girlfriend (fiance the next day!) reserved us a dinner date to this place. I was excited but then again curious on why it was it was so expensive. They must serve some really good cow I thought!\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, the website said the dress code to be business casual/fine dining. We dressed up but saw a few people came in with shorts and a shirt. They seated us towards the side which was kinda of private from the crowd. It was romantic and our waiter was really nice since we asked for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "We started off with a bottle of Cabernet. I don't remember if we had any appetizers or not. If we did, I didn't remember therefor it wasn't a \"wow\" factor. For the main course, I had the filet minion where as my fiance ordered the famous boned rib-eye. We also ordered some asparagus and gratin potatoes on the side which was excellent. My medium filet was cooked to perfection. When they brought out the rib-eye, we were like, \"whoa!\" It was huge... Once she digged in, she couldn't keep her knife off it. It was so juicy and delicious! I was actually eying her rib-eye the whole time. We actually swapped our dishes half way. She is generous like that. :). After being buzz off the wine, and bloated off the food, we finished it off with the creme brulee. It just hit the spot...\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Unfortunately the food was so bland considering the bill came out to 200$. Tried the bone in rib eye had a decent char but very bland no salt or seasoning, filet mignon was the only good dish but lacked any presentation just a chunk of meat on an oversized plate, bbq shrimp appetizer sauce was flavorless, fried oyster were breaded too much and the green pistachio sauce tasted and looked like baby food, the truffle potatoe chips eere drowned in oil, banana pie also tasted plain. Overall lack of love in the cooking and I could find more flavor at a home town buffet. Maybe an off night but the service was good at least until the server realized I had a comp :o went from 100 to 0 real quick lmao. Still tipped 50$\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Always wanted to try it..... too bad it sucked! Lobster bisque was bland, no seasoning... gumbo was so undercooked the shrimp jumped in my water glass! Absolutely no seasoning, bartender warned me that people complain about it having no spice... that was an understatement... now lets talk about the Lobster rolls... brioche buns are great, but when you pretoast them and leave them under a heat lamp it tends to ruin it. The mixture itself was bland.. again.. seems to be in the normal scheme of things.. anyway, after a monumental disappointing lunch, I'm gonna head to the room for a nap. 3 am came way too early!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This is my 2nd Emeril restaurant experience, first is NOLA and I loved it.  It's only getting 4 stars because my lobster was a little too salty.  BUT, the preparation of it has been the best that I have ever had. It was so tender and succulent.  I would definitely order it again, but would remind them to please not salt it so much.  Everything that I ate that night was to perfection.  The salad, the appetizer, filet mignon and lobster.  Our server was also very nice and very on top of servicing our every needs.  The wine that he recommended paired extremely well with our meal.  \n",

      "Yes, the walls are cream colored.  But it's a very clean, fresh feel.  The table are nice and roomy.  The chairs are so big and comfortable, you can sit there for hours enjoying your meal and drinks.  The accent colors in there are a tuscan red, so imagine a nice warm, bright feel.  I really enjoyed it.  Plus it's Vegas, who doesn't hit the lounge or clubs afterwards for the dark, moody ambiance.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] LOVE me some Delmonico! \n",
      "As a big fan of Emeril Lagasse, I had to stop in to one of his restaurants in Vegas, and figured I would have to eat here for my birthday dinner. Definitely, definitely worth it.\n",
      "First off, if you're stopping in, I would recommend making reservations beforehand, as it can get quite busy, especially Friday and Saturday nights. Love the fact that it's in the Venetian, as that's usually my go to hotel in Vegas, and very easy to get to from the Casino floor.\n",
      "Very casual atmosphere, but very upscale service. Our server was fantastic, and we were well taken care of from the moment we stepped in. First class all the way.\n",
      "The food was everything I was hoping for and more. Had calimari for an appetizer- delicious. The bread that came with the meals- delicious. Decided on the filet mignon for main course, with sides of creamed corn and cheese grits. Spectacular. The filet mignon was the best steak I've ever had, bar none. Cooked PERFECTLY, it just melted in my mouth, and you couple that with the creamed corn, which seriously could be the best vegetable I've ever eaten, and holy smokes, you've got yourself a classic meal. \n",
      "Since it was my birthday, I decided on the root beer float for desert. Awesome. It was a New Orleans root beer served with homemade vanilla ice cream, and it was awesome. Just awesome. Plus side- the servers hooked me up with a free chocolate cake type desert because it was my special day! I felt so loved!\n",
      "Overall, I LOVE Delmonico. The prices are a lot more than you'd pay for an outback or longhorn, but that should be a given. The service was spectacular, the atmosphere fantastic, and the food out of this world. If you're looking for a delicious steak dinner on the strip, it doesn't get any better than Emeril's Delmonico. Oh yeah, babe.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Ask ten local 'foodies' to name their favorite Las Vegas Steakhouse and it would be surprising if a single one said Delmonico, and even more shocking if any of them knew that Chef Ronnie Rainwater had been working in that kitchen ever since the restaurant was opened nearly eighteen years ago, yet with family in town and a love of Emeril Lagasse dating back to the earliest days of his expansion to Universal CityWalk it only seemed right to sit down for dinner at the oft-overlooked space in Venetian's RR, a Tasting Menu showing that not only has the restaurant not lost its fast-ball, but that it has learned a few new tricks as well\n",
      "\n",
      "Situated at the end of a string of eateries nearest Palazzo, Mario Batalli's B&B across the way soon to undergo renovations and places like DB, Pinot Brasserie and others come-and-gone since Lagasse chose to bring his New Orleans Steakhouse to Las Vegas in May of 1999, those visiting Delmonico Steakhouse will first notice the large bar previously tended by Max Solano as they approach the space before checking in at a hostess podium, reservations quickly confirmed as General Manager Tuan Tran keeps a watchful eye over an expanse that can easily seat hundreds, the space divided into four different rooms with the most quiet off to the left with the walls lined in Wine and glass\n",
      "\n",
      "Having previously discussed a degustation with both Chef Rainwater and Emeril's Director of Operations Mike Olsen, a fixed price arrangement allowing the kitchen total control over a menu that would be delivered in five courses to highlight Spring, it was after brief greetings from the Chef and a trio of waiters that were a bit 'stiff' but still pleasant that the meal got started, all dishes presented with a comprehensive description from Ronnie with the majority served exactly as they are if ordered a la carte, save for the entrée course and a smorgasbord of Dessert\n",
      "\n",
      "Always tempting fans by way of daily specials via Social Media, as though the menu of Creole riffs on traditional Steakhouse fare from a culinary legend is somehow not enough, it was with a few of Delmonico's signature Pop-Overs paired to creamy, whipped Butter that dinner got started alongside snacks including the longtime favorite Truffle and Parmesan Chips plus crisp Cracklins made from Kurobuta Pork, the kitchen remiss to waste any part of such an outstanding Animal that is also involved in several other plates offered throughout the menu\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting light and working towards heavier items, the second course presenting two specials including Deviled Eggs topped in a big hunk of King Crab and a spoonful of Caviar alongside Burrata tinged in Black Truffles with a vibrant Spring Pea Pesto on top, those looking for something a bit more hearty would be well served to order a warm Spinach Salad topped in Praline Bacon and an Egg that is first lightly poached and then fried crisp before being hemisected, the bright orange Yolk blending with Bacon Vinaigrette to form a coating to each leaf that is slick yet light and acidic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having already experienced many Delmonico classics during two prior visits, but always happy to see the thick Bone-In Bacon with Root Beer Glaze and Pickled Watermelon land on the table, two seasonal plates saw a thick steak of Grade A Duck Liver cooked to caramelizaion on the outside with its smooth center offset by a Hazelnut pastry something akin to Baklava plus sweetness added by Berries; the Rabbit Porchetta wrapped in Prosciutto opting to go all-in on savory with the lean meat carefully complimented by Mushrooms and Pea purée.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getting to the Meat of the menu...or more meatier at least...it was for course four that the kitchen decided to switch up presentations a bit from the typical plated Steaks in favor a large round block of Pork, Beef and side dishes, the Pork Chop about as tender as they get with two Bone-In Ribs showing the Kurobuta Pig in yet another way while the two cuts of Steak were good, but unfortunately not quite on the same level as Jean Georges or Carnevino in terms or richness or texture, the sides mostly forgettable even though others on the menu sounded more innovative while Ronnie's Chicken and Waffles that used to be only offered at lunch again proved to be the city's best-even better than the one offered by Yardbird down the way-thanks to the great Brine, shattering Skin and spicy Glaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point quite full, but assuming the best was yet to come, it was in two large plates decorated with Chocolate that the meal came to its finish, a total of eight different Desserts including a few not yet even listed with highlights coming from all angles, both the Lemon Bar and Key Lime Pie tangy yet rich atop their respective crusts while the Pecan Pie and Emeril's famous Banana Cream version remain indisputable classics, the German Chocolate Cake sadly a bit dry while the Butterscotch Pudding was the sort of thing that almost caused a fight as diners tried to decide who would get the last, creamy spoonful.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The food was good.  The service lacked personal service.  There was nothing superior about the food.  Good food nothing extra special or amazing for the price.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I try not to eat any restaurants inside the hotels.... But this is and exception. This place is amazing. When we walked in the employees were so nice they greeted us and pulled our chairs out for us. The best part was the food. We both got steak and let me tell you that beef was so delicious. Worth every penny. I recommend anyone to at least try it\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Top notch steaks and one of the best wine lists in Las Vegas. Perfectly seasoned and prepared steaks in the main dining room makes for a great night out, but what makes The Delmonico Steakhouse a DESTINATION is their individually planned and prepared tasting menu, available during an evening at their special Kitchen Table. \n",
      "\n",
      "They have a glass room with space for 8, connected to the kitchen where you'll enjoy a special tasting menu prepared by the Chef on duty. And when I say special menu, I mean just that. Chefs are passionate about menu planning and specialty food and they'll give you a 6-8 course meal featuring the steak of course, and many other things not available on their menu, finished with a dessert tray to die for, featured every one of the desserts they offer. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is an Emeril restaurant but you won't see any made for TV dinners here - it's truly an authentic steakhouse with an upscale dining room. For the wine lover, Master sommelier Kevin Vogt will work with the chef to perfectly pair wine with each course. What is special, as of my last visit, is The Delmonico Steakhouse runs independent of the other food services at The Venitian. This means they shop for their own food and manage their own wine collection. So if you enjoy fine wine, perfectly paired with your meal - this is the place for you. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is my #1 all time favorite restaurant. The food is good enough to stand on its own, and because of the special treatment you get at the kitchen table, I've yet to experience anything so great.\n",
      "\n",
      "How much? You'll be shocked and surprised to learn this dining experience isn't terribly expensive. For a little more than you'd spend in the dining room, you get a personal dining experience, about $85 for dinner and wine pairing for about $65.\n",

      "\n",
      "Before we even ordered, we got to try these ox tail thingies, compliments of the chef. Pretty good.\n",
      "\n",
      "We started with the BBQ shrimp. Delish.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the filet, and Hubby had the bone-in filet. According to him, it was extremely good, and he liked it better than the bone-in at Fleming's. I absolutely loved my filet. It had a cajun spice flavor, and it was so good that I didn't even want to dip it in Emeril's version of A1 sauce (yeah.. it's an Emeril restaurant.. didn't know that till I looked at the menu, and I admit initially I was a little turned off by that).\n",
      "\n",
      "We shared asparagus and mushrooms as sides, and their mushrooms were superb. They didn't use the button mushrooms that most steakhouses use. Instead, I think they were shiitake mushrooms, or some sort of mushrooms that tasted similar/looked similar to shiitake mushrooms. Either way, very good.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ended the meal with a complimentary sorbet that was yum, and we also ordered their dessert of the night, which was a blackberry cheesecake that was yum as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, according to Hubby, they had a great wine selection.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Wide whiskey selection, excellent bartenders. I'm assuming the food was good, but even though I came four days in a row I never made it past the bar.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We started with some lobster bisque that was very good.  The rolls were just OK.  My bone in ribeye was very disappointing.  The outside was heavily charred.  The cut itself had much thicker sections of fat than any ribeye I have ever ordered.  After removing most of the carbonized surface, I finally was able to try the meat below.  It tasted like a regular steak.  Not prime, and it lacked the tang of an aged steak.  They told me it was wet aged 3 weeks and dry aged 4 weeks.  I find this hard to believe.  The service was quite excellent and the only reason they are getting 2 stars.  That's twice now I've felt cheated dining at prime steakhouses on the strip.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Been here a couple times, the last one for my birthday in September. Quality and service were phenomenal as always. Ordered the filet mignon with foie gras, mashed potatoes, and their bread pudding. My man ordered the salmon and it was delicious. My friends were very happy with their dishes as well. Even got a complimentary bottle of wine (though I think that was a mistake on their part. Oops!). Needless to say, I'm a fan and will go back whenever I'm in town.\n",

Word of caution here, all four steaks we had at our table, the temperature were missed by close to one notch, rare = medium rare, medium-rare = medium...etc.\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Delmonico's is an institution - but it's by no means a \"5-Star\" steakhouse.  Historically, it was one of the first really credible celebrity chef steakhouses in Vegas - despite the fact that Emeril Lagasse really wasn't the founder of the original Delmonico's of New Orleans.\n",
      "\n",
      "BAD NEWS:  NOT UP TO PAR WITH THE NEW ORLEANS ORIGINAL\n",
      "Patterned after the original which resides in New Orleans, Delmonico's serves delicious, beefy steaks with services & class befitting a Louisiana.  For those of you who've been to the New Orleans steakhouse, let me assure you that like the Vega rendition of \"Commander's Palace\", you will NOT get the same quality at the Vegas \"Delmonico's\".    And that's a shame because to this day, one of the top 3 steaks I've ever eaten was at the New Orleans' Delmonico's... not the Vegas location.\n",
      "\n",
      "GOOD NEWS:  IT'S STILL A GOOD PLACE FOR STEAKS\n",
      "But I don't think you'll leave terribly disappointed.  Everything from the cigars to the baked potato to the crab legs and lobster tails to the steaks themselves - it's all still pretty good.  (More on the beef later.)  Items are always served hot, and plates are served in synchronicity to all guests with multiple waiters.  The wine list is the size of Godzilla and their humidor has a colossal assortment of cigars that would make Bill Clinton giddy.\n",
      "\n",
      "AND WHAT ABOUT THE STEAKS, SERVICE, ETC.?\n",
      "Here's the thing:  They prepare it correctly every time and their service is their hallmark.  However when it comes to different categories (Flavor, service, décor) it kinda varies on how they rank:\n",
      "1) FLAVOR\n",
      "I have to hand it to Envy the Steakhouse over Delmonico's and I think Charlie Palmer's outdoes it as well in most aspects.  Michael Mina's StripSteak probably outdoes it for at least flavor.  Meanwhile Craftsteak has consistently softer, more buttery servings of the same cuts.  It's probably a close tie with PRIME Steakhouse at the Bellagio.  \n",
      "...but it beats going to CUT, Carnevino, N9NE Steakhouse, & Circus Circus Steakhouse in my experience.  \n",
      "2) SERVICE\n",
      "If you're looking for prompt service with an attention to detail, it's hard to beat Delmonico's.  That's something they have down really well.  Only Envy & Charlie Palmer's probably rival it and Envy only gets the nod because there's rarely many people there so service is often 1 to 1.  Everyone else kinda pales in comparison - especially CUT & StripSteak where I've consistently gotten sketchy service.  I strongly suspect that my service would have been 3x better had I had my host make the reservation instead of calling it in myself.\n",
      "3) DÉCOR\n",
      "It's darker, candlelit ambiance is romantic but not very illustrious compared to the views of PRIME or the décor of Carnevino.  Most steakhouses I've noticed are pretty bland and non-descript in general (N9NE is utterly weird - what with all the white walls and junk) though so I'm not sure this is really a big point.  \n",
      "\n",
      "CONCLUSION:\n",
      "Delmonico's, while it's lost some luster compared to some of the other big name talents in the Vegas steak industry, still holds its own amongst the heavyweights.  Kind of a reasonably reliable, middle of the pack, horse that you can depend on for a decent - but pricey - meal.\n",

      "INSIDER'S TIP:  GETTING INTO DELMONICO'S WITHOUT A RESERVATION\n",
      "Very simple:  $50 to the maitre d' will quietly grease your way from having a cocktail at the bar to a table with immediate service usually within 60 seconds - no questions asked.  You'll either need to reach over registration to pass the bill to him/her or call him/her around to shake his hand and simply mention that you appreciate their hard work getting you a table.  \n",
      "...In general, tips really work at Delmonico's in all aspects of the restaurant.  From the wait staff to the bartender to the resident sommelier.  I've pulled this more than a dozen times without fail with the maitre d' during booked solid conventions from CES recently to going back to the COMDEX days.  \n",
      "...This may seem obvious to some, but the key is that the tip angle on 'immediate seating' only works in places where tables are reserved for hotel VIPs.  (For example, Nobu's really has no such seating other than \"next table available\")\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Came here per a friend's recommendation. My friend and I had the bbq shrimp appetizer which was tasty. We ordered the bone in rib eye with a side of mushrooms and spinach.  The steaks are HUGE and topped with butter. Butter makes everything taste better. We both couldn't finish our steaks but it was pretty darn good.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I was actually disappointed a bit by my meal at Delmonico's. I got the duck and it was overcooked. The cane syrup sauce did help bring out the flavor but it was still well done and I was not given the option when I ordered the duck as to how rare/well done I would like it. I do understand that it is a steakhouse, however if it is on the menu it needs to be of equal quality as the red meat.\n",
      "Also, I tasted the mint ice cream profiteroles and the bread pudding served with butter pecan ice cream. Both house made ice creams were the best I'd ever tasted with a fantastic creaminess and balanced flavor, however the bread in both desserts were superfluous, didn't add anything and just weren't that spectacular.\n",

Right from the start they were very accommodating and the service was excellent from seating to enjoying our dessert. \n",

      "I ordered the Chateaubriand and at first glance was not as impressed as my friend ordered the bone in rib steak which looked amazing.

      "first and foremost it is a steakhouse.  so you can go ahead and eat whatever else is on the menu, but if you come to this spot without ever trying their steak youre a foolio.\n",
      "ive been here several times now and each time my experience is stellar on the social and epicurious level.  good service, fantastic food, youre in vegas, what else do you want? (i guess winning jackpot at the casino would round it off nicely, but thats a whole 'nother story :)\n",
      "\n",
      "anyway, so in my opinion, dont even bother with the filet mignon, that cut is way over rated, which fancy pants rich people have turned into this \"exclusive\" non weight bearing tender cut of bovine that the social elite should be eating.  while, all of the tenderness story is true, the flavor is all in the bone in ribeye.  this place uses usda prime aged cut, which is the best you can get.  and get it bone in, the bones give off more flavor in the cooking process.  another sign of a good steak house is if its served with butter, which not every place does, but i personally think makes the meat taste 10x better.\n",
      "\n",
      "one other thing i did like about this place is their dinner rolls served to everyone at the beginning of your dinner.  ya ya, dinner rolls, so what.  well, it was actually fresh here.  freshly made, warm, with a little bit of salt on it.  its like being at an awesome steakhouse that has a pan del sal bakery in it!  all in all, it's great food, great service, good location, being in between the palazzo and venetian, thats all you need.  just make sure you bring money, cause this place is on the pricey side, but have no fear, you will get your money's worth!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Service is excellent. I had the Fillet and it was cooked perfect. My Brother-in-law had the Ribeye and ordered it medium rare. It looked more medium and before he said anything, our waiter came by and noticed. Then he asked to take it back for a new one. The new ribeye came out in less than 2mins. Salads are excellent as well as the cocktails. Second time I've I've eaten there.\n",

      "\n",
      "Total bill for 13 (which included some drinks) was about $1100 which is not bad for a nice high-end place that serves THE BEST RIBEYE.  If you like porterhouse, then go try the porterhouse at Keens steakhouse in NYC.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Excellent steaks.  The best we had on the whole trip.  The wine was also terrific.  The waitress was also very friendly and accommodating.  The only negatives were the side dishes.  The asparagus was just OK and seemed flavorless.  The potatoes were also lacking in flavor.  The steaks are well worth it though and I would go back in a heartbeat.\n",

My girlfriend and I started with the caesar salad which was just wonderful, great flavor and presentation.  We then both went with the steak sandwich with truffle oil fries.  The steak sandwich though not huge was extremely delicious and I mean EXTREMELY delicious.  Everything that went into it was perfect, the spinach, the mushrooms, the grilled chibata, the horseradish mayo, and the wonderful juicy perfectly cooked steak.  It is a bit pricey at $18, but definitely worth the price in my opinion.  The fries weren't anything special and were a bit over cooked.  The setting was nice, but the restaurant was empty and all the guests dining were confined to the front dining room.  Overall great meal, and I will be a repeat customer when back in town.\n",

We were seated promptly.  However, I stumbled on a chicken leg on the way to our table, & it was all down hill from there.  The 16 oz. Ribeye was flavorful, but overpriced, considering it was almost 1/2 fat.  When my boyfriend commented, our waiter laughed & said, \"that's typical for a Ribeye\" & walked away.  After that, we didn't receive any further service from him.  I had the fried chicken, which was $38, & came with black-eyed peas that had no flavor.  Our drinks were just Tito's vodka and cranberry juice at about $14 each.  I had one piece of chicken, & we were done.  The atmosphere was not warm & inviting, & the flavorless food was definitely overpriced.  We were incredibly disappointed & will not eat here, again.\n",

I have had many burgers in my day and let me tell you, THIS IS THE BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. It takes around 20 minutes to prepare, so bring your patience with you....the beef that they use must come from heaven, because this burger is so tender juicy and flavorful.... I could eat another one right now... or maybe half... Thats about all I got through on this....  Its HUGE.....  its $18 bucks and I really didnt care at all when I paid because i felt like this was wellllll worth the money.....  and definitely order the Parmesan chips with truffle oil.... fantastic!!!\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The first time I was here, the steak was great.  We came back today, and the steak was a bit overcooked thought it was still real good.  The garlic mushroom side order is a must.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I seem to have really good luck with Emeril's restaurants. After my recent visit to Delmonico's, I'm beginning to think he can't go wrong. From the moment we walked in the door, it was just instantly different from all the other restaurants we visited. We were greeted warmly, seated immediately even though we were early, and had friendly, attentive service the entire time. \n",
      "\n",
      "The atmosphere inside Delmonico's is not at all what I would have expected, but it is simple and lovely. The colors are warm, the lighting is excellent (especially at a steakhouse, I need to be able to see my food!), and the decor is plain and easy on the eyes (not a lot of decoration at all).\n",

      "We started with some truffle potato chips and a tomato salad to share while we were getting settled. Vince curled up with the wine list with a big, giant grin on his face. Ah, so many choices to go with steak, but we can't really go wrong with Chambolle Musigny, so there you go, and we threw in a bottle of Sancerre to start. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ended up getting Emeril's famous bone-in ribeye, Vince got the filet, and Phil and Alexandra got BBQ shrimp and mushroom medallions. We also got an assortment of sides, including spinach, asparagus, mushrooms, and garlic smashed potatoes. For someone who likes pure, unadulterated meat, my ribeye was about as perfect as you can get. Cooked to my desired rare plus bloodiness, with a simple crust of Emeril's Essence, a beautiful quality cut without any tendons or gristle, just beautiful meatiness. Vince's filet was similarly perfect, nice and thick and bloody, with a delicious cajun rub that enhanced the meat without overpowering it. I was impressed with Alexandra's medallions - they were pretty large for medallions; they looked like big 4 oz filets in their own right. I'd had the shrimp before at Emeril's seafood restaurant so that was nothing new but those were also good. The spinach actually tasted like spinach (rather than cream), and the asparagus was nice and al dente. \n",

      "I finished up with some pecan pie, a generous Jamaica Blue Mountain espresso (I was impressed that the coffee list provided a wide variety of espressos from which to choose), and a cognac. Too bad it was only lunch! This meal was certainly the highlight of our trip (In addition to being the best, it was also the least expensive). Afterwards our server took us on a tour of the restaurant. Next time we are definitely going to try to reserve the chef's table. I already can't wait!\n",

The pappardelle mushroom pasta appetizer was not quite as flavorful a dish as I anticipated, but very good none the less. Also had the truffle and Parmesan potato chips, which are a MUST HAVE!!  The Bone in New York Strip was quite possibly the most flavorful steak I have had in a long time if not ever. The Service was spot on and the atmosphere was relaxed. My wife and I visit Vegas once a year and we will be sure to make it to Delmonico's at least once per trip from now on.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We were in town for our 1 year wedding anniversary and wanted to eat somewhere nice before seeing Phantom of the Opera so my wife made reservations here.  The service was excellent and the food was good.  I was a little under the weather that day (allergies!) so I couldn't taste my food as well as I could have.  But for being sick, it still was very good.  My wife said the wine list was overwhelming so our hostess suggested a nice cab from Napa (I forget the name).  We had a relatively quiet meal; not too loud compared to other steakhouses I've frequented.  We will have a go at that place again next time we are in Vegas; hopefully I won't be sick so I can enjoy my meal!\n",

Freshly grilled skinny strips of bacon that were juicy and meaty.  I'll order it again just for the bacon \"bits\".  The avocado was fresh and creamy... the blue cheese crumbles were rich and blue-cheesy.  All in all, a very nice salad.  \n",

Our servers Michael  and Drew anticipated our every need. The food was swerved elegantly . We had the wilted spinach salad and the baby green salad. Both were wonderful and bursting with flavor. Then came the rib eye steaks! They were to die for. They were huge and very tender. The flavor was outstanding and they were both cooked to perfection. We were too full for desert but had to try the banana cream pie . Whatever you do don't miss it! One piece was plenty for two people to share. The best dining experience ever! Made out trip to Vegas extra special!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My boyfriend and I had NYE dinner at Delmonico and loved it! We chose this place because they were one of the few restaurants that had their regular menu on NYE. The atmosphere is very classy and romantic with fairly dim lights. The service was good. Our waiter did his job quite well. \n",
      "\n",
      "The food was very good. We got their Bone In Ribeye which was massive. Very juicy and tender and perfectly seasoned. My bf loved it. I got their BBQ Salmon and it was so good! I recommend this dish! Esp since its a dish you can't get anywhere else but here! Definitely get it if you like salmon! For sides we got their creamed spinach and fingerling potatoes. Both were good!

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] One of the best restaurants from Emeril.  A group of us dined here while in Vegas.  I ordered the ahi tuna/salmon tartare as an appetizer.  It was amazing!  The ahi and salmon tasted very fresh.  The fish is divied by a small amount of seaweed salad.  It's served with wonton chips, cucumber/onion \"salad\", and a trio of wasabi sauces.  For dinner I ordered the ribeye steak.  It was HUGE.  I was expecting small portions since it's the case at most fancy restaurants. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish my steak.  And most hotels in Vegas do not have a fridge or microwave in the room.  So, I couldn't take it with me.  For dessert, the group shared the bread pudding with butter pecan ice cream, chocolate cake, and pecan pie.  And these were not your typical \"pecan pie\" or \"chocolate cake\".  They were all delicious and decadent! You have to try them to really understand.  Overall, my dining experience was wonderful.  The service is impeccable and the restaurant has a warm ambiance to it.  Yes, it's pricey, but you are going to a famous chef's restaurant.\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I came here for my 20th birthday just recently and I definitely recommend it.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  The steak I ordered was so tender that it practically melted when I touched it with my knife.  And it tasted even better.  I ordered shrimp with it as well and the each piece of shrimp was the size of my fist.  They, too, were delicious.  I received a small dessert with chocolate gellatto and real whipped cream which was awesome.  The one small misstep was actually the funniest part of the night.  My dad was having a gin and tonic and when he requested our main waiter for another one but with more gin in the drink, the second drink arrived in an even smaller glass.  My dad just sat and stared at the tiny little glass as I sat across the table chuckling for the rest of the evening.  So, it looks like you might not want to criticize the bartender.  Other than the sensitive bartender, the evening went off without a hitch.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Perfect service every time! Everything is good and some things great! We were a party of 3 and two ordered ribeyes and I ordered bone in filet. We all ordered the spinach salad. All items are Ordered alacarte but all of the side items are plenty to split 2/3 ways easily. This time we got the corn it is creamy with a tiny kick of chili peppers and a crunch on top of Panko crumbs. The corn is absolutely delicious! The asparagus is just plain steamed asparagus but it is good too. I have had the spinach, the potatoes, the mushrooms, and the grits in the past, all great but this corn was soooo very good. The popovers are served just after drink orders but they are not replenished or served in a basket. Your back up server will just make one round so they are served fresh and warm. If you want more you will have to ask. \n",
      "This time we were not served a complimentary mini appetizer as we had always been served in the past years. We did see other tables served this though. Perhaps because we delayed our ordering due to waiting on drinks and our conversation time. \n",
      "Dessert was the pecan pie. This pecan pie is not the icky sweet oozy gooey pie that I am used to. This one is more tart like, not so sweet or gooey st all. The crust is more cookie like. It was good but I would probably not get this again.  We will stick to the delicious duck egg brûlée or the banana cream pie next time.\n",

I ordered some sides but wasn't even necessary, I couldn't even finish the steak!  Service was great.  A little on the pricey side but worth spending the money at least once.\n",

Service was even to such a level that they helped my lady with her seat, which is good, since the chairs are heavy. \n",

      "As to the food. . . *glarg* *drool*  Sorry, I get moisture in my mouth thinking about it.  Shrimp the size of my thumb after I hit it with a hammer covered in a fantastic spicy cream sauce, steak that you could cut with a spoon, a portion of the most tender venison I've ever had, that was just as good when cold the next day (because I couldn't eat all of it), a martini that made it harder to walk out of there than the amount of food I ate, incredible desserts, and well, an espresso menu that involved such quality coffee I had no idea coffee that good existed.\n",

This trip was for my boyfriend's birthday, so I wanted something Italian and steak as he requested. This was by far one of the best dinners we have ever had. The food was amazing from salads to lobster bisque to a book of a wine list to the Chateaubriand Carved Tableside for Two, which was basically a filet for two cut into strips at our table. It was superb! It has been 3 months and we're still talking about it! My only issue was that the green salad was too salty. Besides that, the steak and sides were seasoned to perfection. The atmosphere was quiet and as if in a well furnished dry wine cellar; very romantic.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, it was VERY expensive but worth every penny. I recommend this to anyone looking for a high end romantic steak dinner in Vegas.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This place was recommended by a friend and I was so excited to try it. I was highly disappointed. At their price point, I expect a certain level of service and food quality. Both were lacking. After getting seated, I had to request a black napkin, which is usually automatic. Not a big deal. After waiting for 5-10 mins, perusing the menu on our own, I had to ask a busboy to find the waiter so I could order drinks. He finally came over and asked if I had any questions and proceeded to recommend the entire menu. Not helpful. We ordered the organic green salad which was excellent. Also got the bone in ribeye. I liked the way it was charred on the outside but it was not well seasoned and the meat quality wasn't top notch like other steakhouses I've been to. The manager came by to do their customary check and I told him the steak was 'pretty good'. He didn't bother asking me why I wasn't satisfied, smiled and walked away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this place doesn't command the price they're charging. Need to clean up their service and food quality. If the salad was the best thing we ate at a steakhouse, that's definitely a problem.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This was an excellent experience from the front desk to the last bite of dessert.\n",
      "The appetizers that we ordered from the nightly specials menu were creative and delicious. The steaks were perfectly cooked and excellent quality. I didn't love the seasonal onions but they were as described and just not cooked to my taste. The desserts were excellent, the creme brulee was perfect. I loved the list of espressos and enjoyed topping off my meal with one.\n",
      "The wine list had moderately priced items and the staff were extremely helpful without being fussy. \n",
      "This was a great experience and I highly recommend it!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Each bite of the bone in rib eye I had was bursting with flavor.  Pure heaven. Service was top notch as was the food.  Had the fillet Mignon as well, also delicious, but the bone in rib eye, that's their money maker!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Delmonico's is one of those few luxurious establishments in which can be hit or miss. On some nights I've received some of the finest steak I've ever had with some decent service to go along with it. Often times, I feel like I deal with waitresses / hostesses who seem to act as if their menu is one of the greatest things about Vegas, which they are sadly mistaken. I've noticed their wine list is impeccable and their decor is really what makes this place scream \"fine dining.\" But sadly because of subpar service and outrageous prices ($51 for filet mignon, 8 oz), its simply fine dining that isn't so fine.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Let me start off by saying this is my favorite steakhouse anywhere. Anytime I'm in Vegas, I have to come here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emerils BBQ strip are amazing, as is the table side Cesar salad. These are a great way to start your meal. \n",
      "\n",
      "For entrees, I have had the rack of lamb, fish specials, etc. All are very good. What keeps me coming back is the bone in rib steak, which is the house specialty. All the beef here is wet and dry aged and amazing. The bone in rib is huge, but you will want to eat every bite and gnaw on the one, although not entirely appropriate at a restaurant of this caliber. Be forewarned that if you order a steak, you get a steak, nothing else. All sides are ala carte and family style. I personally choose to avoid the sides and save the room for the amazing beef. \n",
      "\n",
      "The wine selection here is superb. Whether you are looking for a bottle of the finest bordeaux or simply a great by the glass selection, they have it.\n",
      "\n",
      "For desserts, you can't go wrong with chef emeril. Pecan pie, peanut butter pie, creme brûlée, and banana creme pie, all amazing. Go for the peanut butter pie, or the banana creme, if they are featured that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service here is second to none. The staff is friendly and knowledgable, without being stuffy.\n",
      "\n",
      "When in Vegas, check out delmonico steakhouse, I know you'll keep coming back like I do.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Been wanting to go here for a long time so when a media contact/vendor asked me to lunch here I didn't hesitate!  The ambiance was lovely, low light, tasteful decorations, great big leather chairs.  We had water, bbq shrimp, lobster sliders, steak medallions with side of garlic mashed, chocolate layer cake with coconut ice cream for dessert.  \n",
      "\n",
      "BBQ shrimp was delicious!  Had a homemade bbq sauce that was just tangy, sweet and rich enough.  Large shrimp came with about five I think very yummy.  \n",
      "\n",
      "My entree was the something something steak medallions - (sorry it's not on the lunch menu online and I can't remember exactly what it was called) it was EXTRAORDINARY.  I think after looking through the photos they were the Filet Mignon Medallions - I am a red meat junkie and before this Carnevino was the best steak I ever had - this one ranks right up there.  Perfectly medium rare, flavorful with delicious meaty mushrooms, and as tender as a steak could be.  Just delicious.  Be warned it doesn't come with ANYTHING - just the meat so be sure and order a side dish or two.  I ordered the garlic mashed potatoes which come in this cool metal pan/dish thing.  They are a very large portion so that was good.  The mashed potatoes were soooooooooooooo creamy.  Very very good.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered the chocolate layer cake with coconut ice cream for dessert.  This is why I gave only four stars - the cake a'ight.  Nothing special.  It was enormous though so you'll get the bang for your buck.  My sister is a pastry chef so I might be a little extra picky on my dessert but there you have it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For what we ordered plus my vendor ordered an additional 3-scoop bowl of coconut ice cream on the side it came to $91.  It's pricey - so be sure to eat the warm bread they give you at the beginning so you can be full, lol.  But the portion sizes were generous, the service was INCREDIBLE and the food delish.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I'll start by saying that the ribeye steak I had at Delmonico's was the best that I've ever had, hands down. Even the sides that my fiance and I split: smashed potatos, and asparagus-- were top notch. It's too bad that such an awesome culinary experience had to be ruined by everything else.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off: the decor. VERY spare, with high ceilings. Kind of felt like I was eating in a fancied up gymnasium. The dining room was dark but the sparse spot lighting was harsh, taking away any sort of mellow ambiance they hoped to achieve.\n",
      "\n",
      "About 5 minutes after we were seated, a party of 7 very loud middle aged men came into the restaurant and sat at the table next to us. My fiance and I only ordered salad and dinner, and soda to drink since we don't pay for booze in Vegas. ;) This OTHER table was ordering bottles of wine and appetizers out the wazoo, and the waitstaff took the cue to ignore us and focus on the table that certainly ensured a bigger tip.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a HUGE turnoff. We are very lowkey customers by nature -- no substitutions, no special requests -- I waited tables during my college years so I know what it's like to be on the other side of things. But to sit there for 10 minutes with empty plates and glasses in front of us while 4 or so staffmembers fell over each other at the adjacent table uncorking bottles, getting out appetizers... it was unacceptable. It made us feel like intruders with our lowly $130 bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "PLUS, they charged us for soda refills? at $2.00 a pop. If I'm paying $50 for a steak, don't charge me for a stupid refill of Diet Coke.\n",
      "\n",
      "The meal itself was awesome, but with so many other options in Vegas to choose from, we probably won't be going back. I was happier with the French Toast Slam I had at Denny's earlier in the day: No pretension, my waiter didn't suck, and I didn't get charged for a refill.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Went for my wife's Birthday and was very unimpressed with the food and service. Went to a show before so I dropped a wonderful bottle of wine before and felt insulted when the man at the front desk said \"you know there is a $25 fee for corkage\". If he would have bothered to look at the bottle he would have noticed that it was a very high end bottle of Napa Cab. Anyhow, we were seated and our waiter was trying to tell us how smart and connected he was with all the wineries and  then mispronounced the name of our wine. He never offered to decant it, that was unacceptable. So I ordered the Bone in Rib Eye and it was the toughest piece of steak I have had in a long time. My wife had he filet and loved it. We had creamed spinach and sauteed mushrooms for our side, They were average at best. After mentioning the steak issue the waiter said he would \"let somebody know\". He never came back during service so I never had the chance to send it back. The waiter came back and said that corkage was $ 30 and he got someone to waive it. Funnt the guy up front said it was $ 25. Bottom line was Delmonico did not produce 5 Star food or service. Will not go back.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] OH how I wish I could I was closer. This is by far the BEST steakhouse! Even my kids can tell a huge difference. When we told my kids we were going back for my birthday, they got all excited. Their signature ribeye is lightly season and grilled to perfection anyway you like it. The service is impeccable. I love how everyone gets served at the exact same time. There were 9 of us so we ordered the majority of the sides and everyone got to try everything. By the way one of reasons well ALL love coming here is the truffle oil and parmesan cheese potato chips. If Lays ever made these, I'd be all over them. Normally I never order dessert at a restaurant, but I always do here. They have the best! My favorite this time was the churros! OMG these were the absolute best churros I've ever had! I've been to a may steak houses and this place can not be beat!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Best bone-in rib eye I've ever had in my life!! Amazing food and service. Definitely coming back.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The food was great. We had:\n",

      "\n",
      "I looked at their menu prior to stepping foot into the restaurant so I kind of had an idea of what I would like to order.\n",
      "\n",
      "For our appetizer, we ordered two Parmesan and Garlic potato chips. I'm a chip queen....obsessed and in love with chips but this....this didn't taste that great. =/ The first five chips were good...but after awhile...it tasted WAY TOO GREASY. You know that over greased taste? Yeah...that's what I was starting to taste. It felt like they drenched the entire thing in oil and left it there for days. My party finished the first plate of that but we just couldn't finish the second plate. I definitely would NOT order this again. \n",
      "\n",
      "NEW ORLEANS GUMBO: This gumbo had rice, chicken, sausage and veggies. Pretty good sized portion for a bowl of soup. Small eaters would be half full from this. Seriously...lol. I thought to myself...damn...I hope I have enough room in my stomach for my entree!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "CAESAR SALAD: Typical normal Caesar. It's big enough to share with your entire party.\n",
      "\n",
      "BONELESS RIB-EYE: You have your choice on the menu for bone-in OR boneless rib eye. I was with a fancy date and his party of four other high rollers so I didn't wanna make a mess, that's why I opted for boneless. I've got to admit...it was good...but to be technical, I would rate it at a solid B grade. My rib eye was cooked to my liking, the flavoring was delicious BUT......there were more fatty parts that I would like. =/ eh...not a big fan. But it didn't take away from the complete meal. Great rib eye...big enough for leftovers the next day.\n",
      "\n",
      "NOTE: Three out of the six steak entrees my party ordered was over cooked. Someone wanted medium rare but her steak came out medium. My date ordered medium and it pretty much came out medium well.\n",
      "\n",
      "For our side dishes we ordered potatoes au gratin, asparagus, mashed potatoes, and another veggie dish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can't go wrong with Delmonicos. Def give it a try! Be sure to make reservations.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Pretty good. It was an enjoyable meal although somewhat pricey. Food-wise I ordered the foie gras appetizer, bone-in ribeye, and pecan pie. Even if you like foie gras pass on this one. It was heavily coated in honey and I didn't enjoy it. The bone-in ribeye was delicious and cooked to perfection as was the pecan pie. \n",
      "\n",
      "Delmonico has a great wine list and we ordered a nice bottle that complimented all of our meals and then we ended with a nice 40 year tawny port and coffee. \n",

      "Someone in my group had ordered a filet cooked medium and if was more medium-rare than medium. \n",

      "I would return here but it's not a place that I would make a regular for me when I go to Vegas.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We started out with a cheese and prime rib fondue with pretzels which was outstanding.  The portion seemed small, but was very filling for an appetizer.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the NY Strip and ordered the potato cakes with onions as a side.  The steak was nicely cooked but really lacked flavor.  The best part of the meal was the potato cakes with onions.  I honestly was hoping for a little more BAM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dessert was a disappointment for me.  I ordered the chocolate cake and it was more like a fudge.  I only ate a few bites.  My wife loved her dessert, I just can't remember what she got!  \n",
      "\n",
      "Service was ok... but seeing the service other people got made us realize it was probably just our waitstaff that was lacking.  Other tables actually heard the specials and their waiter made suggestions.  They received sauces with their steaks, we did not.  When I asked our waiter for a dessert recommendation, he basically read the menu.\n",

      "\n",
      "For appetizers we had a sampler plate that consisted of BBQ shrimp, cold crab legs, and truffle oil potato chips. All three were great but the truffle oil potato chips were freaking amazing! These were the first chips I have had in years and I am so glad I chose these to break my no chip policy. \n",
      "\n",
      "For main I went with the filet mignon very rare and it was delicious with the perfect amount of dry rub and no sauce, just the way I like it. Their sides are served family style and I love that. We had the wild mushrooms, creamed corn, asparagus, and garlic mashed potatoes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our dinner lasted three hours thanks to the amazing wine and they never once rushed us to leave. In fact, every time I came back to the table from the restroom (remember lots of wine) they had refolded my dinner napkin. Now that's some damn good service right there! \n",
      "\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I really like Delmonico's.  I've dined here multiple times and have never been disappointed in either the service or the food.  We decided to have lunch here on our most recent Vegas excursion.  My dad tried to get reservations for noon, but was told that they could seat us at 12:30pm instead.  No biggie.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we arrived, there were only about two other tables occupied.  Not sure why we couldn't come in at noon, but whatever.  We ordered the potato chips with truffle oil and parmesan as our app.  I never thought of potato chips as a gourmet dish, but now I know better.  Excellent!\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister and I split the salmon which had a bbq-esque sauce and was served with onion strings.  The waiter actually asked how we would like to have our salmon prepared.  I've never had a waiter ask that before.  Pretty cool.  We also shared a side of broccoli (gotta eat your veggies) and the twice baked potato with white cheddar and bacon (OMG!).  So yummy!\n",
      "\n",
      "For dessert we all split two of the infamous banana cream pies.  Can you say holy banana goodness?  Another OMG moment!  In all honesty, that pie is one of the main reasons we went to Delmonico's.  ;)\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Made reservations for Delmonico, and was looking for a great steak and experience.  This place delivered!  The decor and architecture of the restuarant is unique and modern; it really provides a class of it's own.  The service was superb; not in your face, but they didn't leave you hanging in terms of wanting.  The steak was perfect.  Enough said.  You want a good steak, you expect a good steak, and they deliver a great steak.  Their wine selection is above standard, and the servers are well educated on assisting you.

I'm writing this review half a year after eating here so I don't remember specifics, but I do remember my scallops were very salty (but tender, and huge). What wasn't huge were certain cuts of steak, which basically came in a little cube. Service was amazing though, and the decor in clean, white, and perfect lighting. The inner dining area was better looking but empty at the time, I think they were trying to seat everyone to the outer sides of the restaurants first. Overall, I had a pleasant time but wasn't wow'ed by the flavors or bill. I'll still give Delmonico here in NYC a try though.\n",

      "I'm an adventurous eater and am always open to trying new wine pairings so I just ask for Kevin Vogt (Master Sommelier) for recommendations based on our food order.  You will never be disappointed.  Kevin is a wealth of knowledge and will introduce you to wines that you may not have heard of or tried before.  The great thing is that these wine selections are of great value. \n",

      "For large parties, definitely call ahead and secure a reservation.  Parties of 4 or less should have no problems getting a table with a minimal wait.  If you're impatient or hungry, you should book a reservation just in case there's a convention in town.  This place gets busy!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Delmonico is another place that I've eaten at a number of times (over a span of close to 10 years), and it is always consistently fantastic.  The food, especially the steak, is always wonderful; however, the menu does not change often.  Thankfully, with items like the gumbo on the list, the stale menu isn't as big a problem as it could be at other fine dining establishments.  As you would expect, the steaks are incredible, and Delmonico is home to my favorite filet in Vegas.  The dessert leave a bit to be desired, but I am generally way to full to be bothered with dessert anyways.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service here can be hit and miss, and it seems to depend on where in the restaurant you are seated - up front by the entrance and you're being hounded by a swarm of waiters, runners, and sommeliers, while if you're seated toward the back of the restaurent, you tend to be a bit underserved.  The atmosphere is definitely a bit stuffy, but that doesn't stop the occasional jackass in a football jersey or cowboy hat from sitting down at the table next to you.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall a great restaurant, however I would recommend Table 10 in the Palazzo.  Table 10, another Emeril establishment, is far less stuffy and has a very similar menu and food quality, at about two-thirds the cost of Delmonico.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] HELLO!!?!?! This place was SO GOOD. We had the table side Caesar Salad which was delicious of course and I had the filet mignon and boyfriend had a big bone in rib eye. We had scalloped potatoes as our side and everything was truly amazing. Our server said Jay-Z and Beyonce were there about one month prior which made us feel like our choice of eating here was a good one. We went to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and I let them know that when I made reservations. They did a great job of making sure everyone that encountered our table knew that which was nice- made us feel really valued. A really beautiful steak dinner and they did an excellent job of making our special occasion extra special. SO GOOD!!! Steak was cooked to perfection and the cajun rub that they put on it was really a nice touch. Can't hate anything with a large pat of butter on top either- of course it was everything I had hoped this filet would be and more. The crispy outside of the cajun spices was really a nice addition of course an emril style thing you'd hope for. YUM!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Bread pudding and bone in rib eye and wine makes it 5 stars but the sides are so so ... Good not exceptional more to come...Finished dinner- still reminiscing about the bread pudding....its creamy, not to sweet, enough raisins, and ice on top- w/ pecan candied crunch- perfection.  the bone in rib eye is good- not the best I have ever had.  The reason being the ration of fat to meat was a little high- i do like marbled fat in the steak but when 1/3 of the steak is fat...i couldn't eat it w/o thinking of clogging my arteries.  Wine was exception- the Italy-\"Vertigo\" was yummy.  The best experience for me was spending it w/ my girl-riends esp for her 30th B-day! the service makes you feel grown up and independent!.

The main was the bone-in ribeye medium on the pink side and went with the Oscar style, jumbo lump crab meat, grilled asparagus and béarnaise. Also had the country smashed potatoes and a must have cream corn gratinee. We shared everything and still had left overs. Service was great and food was on par. Will definitely come back.\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I really enjoyed my Vegas trip here and this spot was one of the reasons.  Its an older looking restaurant and by that I don't mean décor but class.  I should have said its more of a matured restaurant.  The spot is elegant and classy. From the hostess to the waitress, this spot screams fancy.  We had a lovely dinner here during our Vegas trip.   Before dinner we grabbed a few drinks.  They were really solid.  I guess in Vegas I can be a bit more loose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Located inside the Venetian, it was actually my second time visiting this hotel.  Its an incredible spot. I love everything about it.  We were seated and given a menu.  After about a few minutes were decided to run with the bone in ribeye.  Boy was I in for a treat, tasty treat.  The meat was super juicy.  The juices flowed through with every bite.  Cooked to perfection, this piece of steak is highly recommended in my books.   To be honest, when it arrived I wasn't sure if I was gonna be able to finish it but after several bites, I kept at it, wanting more.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall this was actually one of my favorite restaurants.  I caught a glimpse of this spot a few years back and had been wanting to give it a try ever since.  Finally I was able to and it was worth it.  The bone in ribeye is definitely my favorite for about 55 bucks.  The filet was solid too I'm told by my counterpart, but no regrets on my end.  We had a lovely time.  Chances of returning are very high.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Delmonico's is a very good steak house. We had an excellent meal and the bone-in ribeye was huge and pretty flavorful.

      "summer in vegas is a miserable time, and my sisters and i braved that heat by looking at the bellagio water fountain in awe.  that water show is still the favorite part of my trip every time i go to vegas.  of course, this all happened before \"ocean's eleven\" featured that famous last scene.  i don't think we looked as cool as brad and george though...\n",
      "\n",
      "i swore to myself that i'd never be back to this city after our incident at a club.  we got kicked out for having too much fun!!!  it was for a bachelorette party, and i think paris hilton was slightly jealous because we drew more crowd than her performance on that night.  we continued to party on in our suite and i discovered that night that jacuzzi could make even the most prude girl hot and steamy!!!\n",

      "i am no longer young nor have enough energy to party all night, but vegas proved to be a great place to have some of the finest dining experiences one can enjoy.  this time, our sole purpose of the trip was to eat at delmonico steakhouse, and what a fantastic night we had!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "some of us had been here before, so the night started with the chef's complimentary appetizer which was a capane of smoke salmon on puff pastry.  a bottle of red wine was chosen from their extensive wine list along with fried calamari and barbecue shrimp as appetizers.  i can't make a comment on the wine, but the calamari had overwhelming amount of olives for my taste.  i did love the shrimp as they were cooked perfectly in that tangy sweet bbq sauce.\n",
      "\n",
      "some of us were disappointed that the restaurant no longer offered pork chop, but the special of the night was pork tenderloin with braised bacon, and they happily opted for it.  a couple of us ordered a bone in filet, the bf ordered a bone in ribeye and i got a filet mignon.  my butterflied medium steak was perfectly charred outside with some pink inside and it was very tender and juicy.  i tasted the pork dish and i loved every part of it.  i never knew that a chunk of bacon could be so buttery and sweet, and the cane syrup they used to braise was just perfect for that white fatty meat.  the highlight of the night was the bone in ribeye.  that thing was huge with so much flavor!!!  i rarely eat any pink meat, but the bf's medium rare steak was so delicious i didn't care for the color of it.  seriously, if you ever get a chance to go to delmonico, get their bone in ribeye.  you'll thank me forever for the best steak ever!!!\n",

      "we also ordered sauteed garlic mushroom and roasted fingerling potatoes.  it was a mushroom heaven with all different kinds of them (shiitake, button, oyster, portebello, etc) cooked in chopped garlic and the aroma itself could make someone's mouth watery.  those purple, yellow and red potatoes side dish was recommended by our maitre d' and it didn't disappoint us.  maybe it could be too heavy for a light eater with all that meat, but for a person like me (a meat & potato girl), i couldn't ask for a better meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "i must say this steakhouse is a place to impress someone.  it's a huge restaurant, but since it was sectioned into 3 different rooms, it rather felt intimate and quaint.  small tables were cornered so you could be private and although the restaurant was busy, i never felt rushed.  the waiters were not those friendly joker types, but the service we received was more than adequate and appropriate.  \n",

Hands down this place rocked!  The service was amazing, the food was fantastic..... I am an Emeril fan so I was excited to try it out.  The prices was very reasonable especially for being a top rated Vegas strip restaurant. Excited to try the other locations in NYC and NO now!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Not really sure why I waited so long to write my review, however here it is.  In one word.  Fabulous.  It has always been a dream of mine to come here.  So, my fiance booked us a trip and made it happy (love him).  We arrived and was seated right away.  We had our first experience of a  two person wait staff attending to us.  The meal was superb.  I had salmon and sides and my fiance had the rib eye and sides.  The meal was flawless.  We had good conversation with the wait staff to the point where when we discussed how we were from MD, he introduced us to another staff member (who wanted to meet us because she was from our area too).  We had great conversation.  I usually don't get dessert when I'm out because I'm usually too stuffed to do so, but the wait staff insisted and comped it because it was my birthday.  Just to mention, we had to change our initial reservation time and I was worried thinking we wouldn't be accommodated but we did so with no issues.  This restaurant is located in the Venetian Hotel and depending on where you come in at, may take a little while to get to.  The other part of the place that was hard to navigate to was the restrooms, it was to the right of the seating area down the hall and if I remember correctly, you pass by/can see inside of the kitchen on the way.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I came here for my birthday dinner Sunday night. The steak and rib eye was delicious, nice atmosphere and good, attentive service. I recommend the bbq shrimp as an appetizer, fully loaded with flavor.\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I kinda view the steakhouse experience from several angles. Not just the price, but also the entrees and sides, the pairing with wine, the atmosphere waiting in line.\n",
      "\n",
      "I personally liked the atmosphere, as it was nice to have dim lighting for a late 9pm dinner. The waiting bar was nice, although the seats are very very low. A nice confidence booster for short folks, but some might find it uncomfortable. \n",
      "\n",
      "Inside the restaurant, seats are very comfortable. Unlike my counterparts Don and Elmer, I ordered the standard NY bone-in steak. Very good, my only complaint was that it wasn't boneless! The wine was great; the waiter was helpful in selecting a bottle, very tasty but not too pricey for 4 near-thirtysomethings. The side dish of warm spinach salad(which yours truly ordered) was the showstealer of the night. Everyone liked it, so keep it on your radar if you go.\n",
      " \n",
      "Overall, I thought it was great. I gave it 4 stars, though it would really be 3 and a half stars. If you want a better selection of steaks, probably go to Ruth Chris, NERO or the Bradley Ogden restaurants. In Vegas, the benchmark is BOA, but BOA can get very very pricey. But for the value and overall celebrity restaurant experience, a good experience. Definitely make reservations thru the casino or through opentable. I would go again with a small group or for an intimate dinner with my girlfriend.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Best steak I ever had. Staff is great. Went there for my 40th B-day. Couldn't get a table in the restraurant so host suggested we try the bar. Bartender was great, got us 4 seats on the bar with a full menu. Steak was incredible. We my wife told him it was my B-day he brought us a banana foster dessert. Completely unexpected and very thoughtful. Really made for a great evening. Now, every time we go to Vegas we go there for dinner. I don't know which is better, the food or the service.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I went here with a few friends of mine and was BLOWN away. And to think, I almost didn't even go. I was feeling cheap and didn't want to spend a grip on dinner, but boy am I glad that I went and had the wonderful opportunity to eat at this fabulous restaurant with some dear friends of mine. \n",
      "\n",
      "First off, the ambiance is very simple, understated, and clean. Nothing overly done. In fact, I heard it was on purpose so that you can focus on the food and the people rather than the art and ambiance of the place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, service is top-notch. If you're paying the big bucks, it's no wonder. They totally spoil you here and answer all your silly questions!\n",

      "\n",
      "As we sat down we were great by two men who were going to be our servers and our waiters for the day. I ended up ordering a Bone In rib Steak. I think it was the most expensive steak on the menu. I wasn't too sure about the size but my friends that came before said that it was a good size and that some of them couldn't finish it. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I finally got the steak. It had a little piece of butter on the top and it looked good. I usually have my steak medium and it was perfect. I loved it. We also ordered some sides of grits, spinach and mushrooms. Those were ok to me. I loved the steak though. I wasn't able to eat the last 3 oz or so. I think it was well over 16 oz steak with the bone. I think everyone finished theirs except for me. I did notice that my friend said the my steak looked bigger. I couldn't complain at all. All in all we spend about $80 for dinner. I didn't order anything besides the steak and splitting the appetizers. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was well worth it. I have spent more at other places and not even felt like I was eating enough. This takes the cake. \n",
      "\n",
      "I liked how the servers were prompt with filling up my water and attentive to our needs. They would even fold your dinner napkin if you left the table. Awesome. I felt somewhat cramped on our circular table, but what do you expect from a large group of 9 guys.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] One of my favorite dishes is Rack of Lamb.  When I'm traveling for work and see it on the menu, I have to try it.  My bar of measure is Mr. B's in New Orleans French Quarter part of the Brennan family.  Short of flying to Paris to find a fair place to compete against Mr. B's grilled lamb chops, Delmonico's certainly gave Mr. B's a run for its money.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried Delmonico's without looking at yelp first - in some countries I would be shot for this crime - and not knowing that Delmonico's even existed.  It was after a long day of work and simply being hungry, I walked into the first restaurant that was open without even looking at the menu.  When I was seated and handed the wine list, I knew I had found the right place, almost by divine inspiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wine list was more like a wine book, only dedicating the last page to single glass selections.  The rest were bottles only.  This is where I figured out I was in a place worthy of my pallet.  They had 15 different vintages of Caymus Special Reserve.  Most fine dining places maybe have one or two at most.  Of course since the company was paying and no one to split a bottle, I could not in good conscious order a bottle.  I would have been hung by the accounting department.\n",
      "\n",
      "The waiter gave the specials of the day and I of coursed b-lined for the lamb chops like a rabid dog.  When the dish arrived you could smell the fine attention to detail that the chef had prepared.  The Colorado rack of lamb with Roasted Cipollini Onions, Haricot Vert and Brandy Peppercorn Reduction staring back at me was love at first sight. \n",
      "\n",
      "I order my rack of lamb medium rare. Anything else would be blasphemous to the animal who sacrificed itself for my dining pleasure.  The lamb was tender and juicy all the way through.  The vegetables, especially the Cipollini onions soaked in the tender juices of the lamb melted in my mouth.  This was a meal that reminded me why it's so good to be alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "My only regret and no fault to Delomico's is I broke and tried the bread pudding for desert.  Being an Emeril restaurant I figured why not.  Being a bread pudding connoisseur and having such a spectacular experience with the lamb, I had high expectations.  I will be fair and say I was offered the key lime pie instead but I stayed true to course and ordered the bread pudding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was it bad? No but it was certainly average for the area and if placed in New Orleans, it wouldn't even register on the map.  Delmonico's is marketed as \"creole\" restaurant and as such looses a star for the poor attempt on their bread pudding.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Will I be back? Absolutely without a doubt! Will I be ordering the bread pudding? No and if have a hankering for bread pudding after your meal at Delmonico's, mosey yourself on down to Gordon Ramsey's Pub and Grill.  Order the spotted dog and you will be in bread pudding heaven.  With that said, Delmoico's is in my top three restaurants of all time in Las Vegas.  If you don't mind spending a pretty penny on dinner and you're a true fan of food, Delmonico's is hands down one of the finest restaurants in Las Vegas.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This has been the first time I've been disappointed going to a steakhouse in Vegas. We had a reservation for 8 and Delmonicos and everyone almost hated their steak or fish. I myself had a halibut, but also shared the ribeye. I also had a taste of the lobster bisque. the bisque was very good and could recommend that. but as for the halibut and steak, they were very salty. our whole table said the same thing about the steak and fish. we were very surprised that we were disappointed at an emeril restaurant. maybe the chef in the back had a bad day. in the end, you wont see me here again.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Impeccable service and outstanding steaks!  But then again what do you expect it's Emeril and Las Vegas!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I just want to say this restaurant is amazing! From the customer service to the staff. 2 months ago I had my waiter I believe his name was Gregory, well he by far, was the best waiter I've had. He was attentive, kind, and willing to always help and check up. This is what makes guests like myself keep coming back here. Keep it going Delmonico! -Diana Habash\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Almost perfect except when they screwed up my steak order and made it well instead of medium. Staff was very understanding and quickly replaced my steak with the correct order (seriously, my table mates maybe got another one or two bites in before I had a new plate...so quick!) otherwise everything went well. At the end of the meal, my cousin asked for a tour of the kitchen (she's a CIA grad) and they let her check it out.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I've been to Ruth's, Mastro's, The Palm, & Morton's and I will have to say that the Rib-Eye (not bone-in) I had here was the BEST I have ever had (not that the others were bad). \n",
      "\n",
      "I may be partial to the spice \"rub\"/\"crust\" they put on it which is not traditional for high end steak places which favor only salting their meat, but honestly I wish other places seasoned their meats a little more. It was truly delicious. My brother ordered the NY and my aunt ordered the Filet and they were both in agreement I had the best tasting steak.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was exactly what you would expect and demand from a place in this price range and all the sides and appetizers were definitely good (but not great).\n",
      "\n",
      "Their wine list is literally an encyclopedia of wine so it was a little intimidating and I opted for a glass of Scotch instead. \n",
      "\n",
      "In comparison to some of the newer & flashier spots like SW & CUT the ambiance is a little muted but its still classy. Like I stated, go here and order the regular Rib Eye.. I highly doubt you will be disappointed.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Wow. That Rib Eye Steak was awesome! So were the appetizers, caesar salad, sides, dessert, and wine. We went all out here and ordered much more than our stomachs could handle. But it was all so good I had to eat every last bit and piece.\n",
      "\n",
      "The steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly. It was extremely tasty and was a nice big cut. The service was excellent. The caesar salad which was created table-side was fun to watch and tasted incredible. It would have been nice if they gave us a little bit more time between the salad and when our steaks came out. The steaks were actually waiting for us in the aisle before we had completed our salad.\n",
      "\n",
      "This meal was a fun place to go out with a group and the food was very high quality.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My family went here for Fathers Day at noon. The place had a very nice atmosphere. We sat two minutes after checking in.  Five minutes later, a waiter approached us and took our order for drinks. He introduced himself and another waitress. We got our drinks and ten to fifteen minutes later, a different waitress gave us bread.  A person in a suit then approached us to ask if we were ready to order. We replied, \"Yes\".  He then walked away instead of taking our order. I would assume that he is the manager.  A different waitress then approached us to Finally take our order.  This took more than half an hour from the time we sat down.  Sad thing was that the table behind us sat after we did and was already eating their appetizer before someone took our order.  Mind you, we sat before several customers and they were attended to first. Very very poor start of customer service.  I would think that this place would have excellent service consistently.  Another, I had black slacks on. I placed the napkin on my lap, and behold the napkin left tons of white lint on my black pants.  I went to other restaurants in Vegas and I was offered a black napkin to use instead.  Others, the napkin did not leave as much lint as this one did. I ordered the lobster bisque, which was excellent. Creamy, smooth, and a lot of flavor.  I also ordered the filet medallions.  It had panko breading which I really didn't care for.  The bacon was charred and hard, but the two filet medallions were great.  It also had a simple sauce with small mushrooms. My dad had the lobster sliders.  The sliders were surprisingly great according to my dad.  They didn't skimp on the lobster.  Instead of shredded pieces, they are a generous portion in the sliders.  The bread they offered got cold pretty quick but it was still good to eat.  At first, drinks were coming in slow. Then the waiters paid more attention to us in the end.  The restroom was located all the way in the very back.  I thought I had to exit the building itself to use the restroom.  You have to through a very long hallway to the very back towards the exit sign.  The sink was shallow and I could barely wash my hands in it since it's so shallow that my hands will get wet from the dirty water in the sink.  There was only one sink available.  Food would have been excellent.  Service was mediocre.  I'm not sure I would return here if I have this kind of service.  It was my first time here.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Unbelievable. Delmonico's was an unforgettable experience from start to finish.  We went there with a group of six to celebrate a 30th birthday. We called two days in advance to make a reservation (you can do it on their website too).  \n",
      "\n",
      "We arrived and were seated immediately and it was then that I realized that it would be a dining experience. We had 4-5 servers around out table at any given time. We were immediately served water, delicious little bread knots, and out drink orders were taken. I thought it was interesting that they did not give a drink menu, rather the server recited all drinks in the given category to each person (wines: red or white, beers: IPA or Stout etc). Then they reviewed the menu with us and took our orders. There were many specials available, and they brought us a sample of a cheese tomato pesto flat bread, on the house. \n",
      "\n",
      "The meal took a good 20 minutes, but it was worth every second (and dollar!). I had a filet, which was prepared to perfection. Sides are a la carte, and family style. The green beans, potatos au gratin, and country smashed potatoes were to die for. Very very delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is hard to imagine, but the servers were almost too hovering. They filled your water after one or two sips. They definitely took care of us to any need. The prices are high, but worth it. Delmonico's is something I will always remember about Vegas.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The traditional New Orleans Gumbo was tasteless, the lobster bisque was too salty, the jumbo lump crab salad was anything but fresh, the BBQ shrimp was swimming in BBQ sauce......, we were amazed by the poor quality of food this restaurant serves, we ordered great wine and that's the only thing we finished, service was O.K.  I would skip this restaurant altogether.\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Ambiance is zilch -- honestly I don't know how the decor could be more plain and completely un-styled.  Sommelier unfamiliar with the wine we picked.  Steak was cooked correctly, but thin (for a premium steakhouse) and presentation was poor -- cooled and congealed greasy sauce/butter.  I am skeptical of the USDA Prime rating for this steak -- it was nowhere near as high quality as other Prime steaks I've had.  Creamed spinach was oddly tough and chewy -- I don't even know how that is possible but it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the plus side, the lighting is effective and the whisky and bourbon selection is great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service felt very scripted and impersonal.\n",

      "I can't believe the reputation this place has.  I guess it is Vegas, and when people pay top dollar they put on their rose tinted glasses and fail to see that the emperor has no clothes.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it was not for the price and reputation, i would say it was a decent meal.  But it was so not even in the same ballpark as meals I've had for the same price at El Gaucho, the Metropolitan Grill, Wolfgang's in Manhattan, and steaks in Brazil and Argentina.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] They have a barely manageable lunch menu, but their dinner menu and wine list is great.\n",

      "I love RIb Eye's everywhere, so I tried to go for the New York Strip, it was just ok.  Fortunately, I tried my friend's rib-eye and it was as expected, quite good.  Their sides are all above par, but make sure you look through their wine list - you will find a few gems in them!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Damn you Emeril Lagasse.  Damn you and your fantastic service and amazing steaks.  I am ruined for life from any other restaurant.  Nothing will ever compare.  \n",

      "\n",
      "So surprise, surprise, I ordered the rib-eye.  My wife ordered the filet mignon.  My impression before we received our dishes was that this was an upscale place so we were expecting meats on the level of Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.  I was slightly disappointed in that their rib-eye, although good, I felt was only slightly better than a Black Angus steak.  I've had a much better tasting rib-eye from Smitty's in Pasadena.  The filet was nice and tender so that was the bright spot during our dinner date.  We also ordered a couple of glasses of cab and so it complemented our steaks very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was, as you would come to expect, excellent.  If it wasn't for the rib-eye, which was lacking some flavor, I would've given it a 5-star rating.\n",

      "I went here for my birthday with my family. We started off with the cheese assortment! Great! A perfect blend of cows milk, sheep's milk and goats milk cheeses from mild to sharp! The almonds and honey rounded the dish off nice. For the main course We each had a different cut of meat. That was so we could \"share experiences\" and explore the menu. It was a great idea. I had Ribeye, my husband had the bone in ribeye, my brother had the filet and my mother had the filet prime special. Omg! All was juice, perfectly cooked and promptly brought to the table! Our sides were delectable!! Creamed corn and potatoes gratin accompanied the steaks perfectly. Honestly, the only thing lacking in my opinion was the overly simple décor! Other than that I'd return in a heartbeat!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] First off, to make the most of your experience, you should know what to expect from Delmonico service by doing your Yelp homework. This place doesn't get a full 5 stars because of the service. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's been a while since I've felt so insulted by a server. I don't even know his name since he didn't introduce himself, so I know him as the big guy with a beard. He was unfriendly and wrote us off immediately when the table next to us wanted to share half of their seafood tower with us (it's massive and delicious by the way... thank you amazing strangers from New Mexico!).\n",
      "\n",
      "We were celebrating an anniversary and greeted warmly by the host stand, but while other Yelpers say that their servers brought them a scoop of sorbet to celebrate, we got nothing.

      "- Creamed spinach- Not too heavy on seasoning, but perfectly delicious and enjoyable. Perfect with the ribeye.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Lobster bisque- if you get this, I would highly recommend sharing. It's too rich and heavy to eat a whole bowl.\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Since this was my birthday trip we wanted(I wanted) a great steak dinner. As if I need a reason for a good piece of meat. We arrive 15 mins before our reservation and within 2 mins are seated. The place looks like an art museum very light and earthy colors. The seats are a bit uncomfortable as someone also stated. They are leather office chair styled, I kept sliding off of them. Now enough of that, the food: the server: Darren comes around and gives us menus we look it over- I see what I'm ordering- the filet $48, side $9 and I also want an appetizer $18 damn $80 and that's just my meal. Now I'm used to spending this on sushi so I wasn't vexed. My poor husband who until me, wasn't used to spending so much on a meal was sweating. Ha! I'm just kidding, so to be semi fair we order the gumbo $10 split, the bread they have is phenomenal a cross between hawaiian bread & monkey bread, and it gets served one by one for each person.  Kind of annoying because it's that good but it comes out fresh so one can't complain. The gumbo is decent enough for a restaurant such as this. We order the chateaubriand $105 for a beautiful piece of steak, garlic smashed potatoes, and asparagus for two. Bam! Look @ me saving us money. This was our first time having the chateaubriand and this will not be my last, very well seasoned w/ herbs& spices and nice encrusted char. It was more than enough food for two. And @ the end of our meal they brought me a candle lit sorbet sweet treat for the bday girl. Our service was top notch from start to finish. A well worth $200.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] A fancy steakhouse with minimal decor, Delmonico's was recommended as the best place for steak in Vegas by several people.  Everything was very tasty and well seasoned, but we didn't find the food to be spectacular as expected.  Not sure if it was all the alcohol we have been consuming the past 2 days, but none of us could finish out 16 ounce steak - which was a damn disgrace in our books.  Though overall the experience was good, we doubt we would return anytime soon because there are just so many other steakhouses in the city to try out.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] we got here at 730pm with reservations at 8pm, so we waited for a little bit in their \"lounge.\" here, i asked for water, and the waitress gracefully brought me a glass, even though we were probably expected to order an alcoholic beverage. we waited about 15 minutes in their lounge, and then a waitress took us to our seats. the restaurant was surprisingly large, and we were seated in the middle of the back room. i was surprised at the decor, it was rather.. plain.  plain white walls with dim lighting.. it kind of felt like we were just being seated in a large room. after sitting, the waiter explained to us about the menu, and then left a very large book of alcoholic beverages for us to look over as well.  the menu wasnt too large, which was good for indecisive people like us. :)\n",

      "to start, we ordered a Lobster Bisque ($12.50) to share, esp after reading the rave reviews about it here. like i said, not hyped. it was sensational. it was so smooth, creamy, and rich, mMm.. i'm drooling right now just thinking about it. for our entrees, i ordered the Colorado Rack of Lamb ($48) with a side of Roasted Fingerling Potatoes ($9), and the friend ordered one of their specials of the night--Blue Cheese covered Bone-in Filet with Bacon ($55) with a side of Sautéed Garlic Mushrooms ($9). i'll start with the sides. the potatoes were okay.. nothing too spectacular.. a little bit on the salty side.. but it was a good side if you need veggies (or veggie-related) along with your meat. the mushrooms were good. tasty, cooked nicely, and i dont even like mushrooms! i ordered the lamb cooked to medium, and it was still slightly too red for me, but it was good nonetheless. a little bit on the fatty side, but it was tasty, and came with a popover.. which is this egg-battered bread thing that went really well with the lamb sauce. i actually had a bite of the friend's steak before i dug into my lamb, and boy.. that steak was FABULOUS! the blue cheese, bacon, steak, and tangy sauce that came with it made the steak utterly orgasmic. perfect blend of flavors. the meat practically melts in your mouth. friend got the steak in medium rare, but it seemed slightly more cooked than it should've been. it definitely didnt take away the tenderness though, this was the best steak i've had in my life (and i only took a couple of bites from it). this was one of the specials though, so it probably wont always be available. just writing about it right now is making my stomach grumble. i was craving to see what their desserts would taste like. we decided to go with the Chocolate Bread Pudding ($10). it was really chocolate-y, but for chocolate-lovers like me, it was perfect. it was the cherry on top of an already great meal.\n",

Our dinner was good but I have to say that I was disappointed that they did nothing to acknowledge my birthday celebration. We chose this restaurant over STK & CUT to celebrate the occasion and I wish we hadn't. They did nothing to acknowledge our occasion which was sad. I will not be going back to this restaurant again.\n",

He was there for a job interview and this was our one night out together. The food was good. I got the mixed greens salad and he got the wilted spinach salad. Both salads were very good, especially the wilted spinach. We each got the NY Strip, medium rare. It was not overcooked, which was nice. I thought the rub and char on the steak was good but my husband did not like it at all. We got the creamed corn and mashed potatoes for sides. Creamed corn was very good but the potatoes were a little bland. \n",

      "As we were leaving we noticed the signs for a 3 course prix fixe menu. This sign was outside the restaurant and we both remembered seeing it as we entered, but after waiting inside, being seated, and then getting menus we did not remember this. We asked if that menu was currently being offered, and it was. There was a separate insert inside the menu, however, neither of our menus had it. We asked to speak to a manager and he apologized and said it must have been misplaced, or the customers before us didn't insert them back into the menus. Yes, the manager stated that it is the customers' responsibility to make sure their menus are current. It was quite suspicious that NEITHER of our menus had this insert. This makes us suspect a deliberate move by our very attentive waiter. The bigger bill we paid meant a bigger tip for him. We don't care about the money; we feel like this restaurant took advantage of us and the manager did absolutely nothing to try to rectify the situation except make inappropriate excuses.\n",

      "Lamb chops - Very well done. The lamb was cooked well(medium rare) and was nice and juicy. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the ribeye(rare). I thought it was on the verge of medium rare, but totally acceptable. Nice flavor, and good portion. Not the best steak i have had, especially since the waiter said it was both wet and dry aged. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sauteed spinach - Very good, but i would have preferred a bit more creaminess to it. Although i am not sure if it was supposed to be cream spinach or not, it seems almost like it was halfway between steamed and creamed. either way it was a very good side dish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Filet - Very well cooked and tender. I found the truffle crust lacking in flavor though, as i could not really taste it at all.\n",
      "\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This is by far the best steakhouse that I have been too. Maybe I say this due to the lack of high end steakhouses I have been too. But everything to me here blew my mind. \n",

Let me back track a little bit though. I made a reservation for four on open table... we were running a little late so I called and to let them know. They were very friendly and accommodating with our late arrival. As soon as we get there, they said \"You must be Jason, party of 4 correct?\" Very nice touch for a first impression. We were greeted by our main server, followed by the assistants. Our server made good conversation and awesome recommendations. We never felt bugged, rushed, or belittled (since we all look pretty young). Even with the huge wine list, we were scratching our heads and our server recommended a VERY good syrah that fitted within our budget.\n",

As other couples in the room finished no one was reseated in our area (the stone walled room with the wine 'wall').  As the group became louder their language also worsened to the point of being profane and the mention of male body parts.

I ordered my filet medium rare and it was definitely medium rare as our helpful and attentive waiter, Ryan, had described it.  The other dishes my dining companions had were the pepper-seared ahi tuna, grilled petite beef medallions, and spicy jumbo shrimp with fresh fettucine pasta.  All of which they loved.  \n",

How nice was that?!  Excellent food, excellent service - highly recommend dining here.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We originally booked reservations at another restaurant. Then we decided to go to the Diana Ross show so decided to go to Delmonico so we wouldn't have to rush after the show. What a great choice. We had the fries oysters and I could've had three orders. They were perfectly prepared and so savory! We were served several piping hot pop over rolls with rosemary baked into them. They literally melt in your mouth. It was late and we weren't super hungry so we decided to try several small plates.  We split the salmon. The salmon was perfect. A bit spicy, a bit sweet with potato hash and andoulle sausage. We also had the creamed spinach, BBQ shrimp and the grits. I didn't love the grits but everything else was awesome. They have a full selection of bourbons (an entire book) which made my bf very happy. I had a really crisp Rose' .. it was really good. The staff works as a team to make sure no needs go unmet. Nicole was so engaging and accommodating. We will go back next time we are in town.\n",

      "Lobster bisque. eh.\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I have yet to have a bad meal here.  Have eaten here many times.  I usually make it a point to order their Rib-eye but on this particular visit, due to it being lunch hour, I ordered the Big Eye Tuna salad.  It was damn delish.  Afterwards I got my sweet tooth on with their sorbet mix (mango/strawberry/raspberry).  The only way to make the sorbet any better was if I was sitting in a comfy recliner with a warm blanky on me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back to the Rib-eye.  I don't eat red meat often but this place rocks a mean steak.  I save my red meat Jonesing while in Vegas for eating here.  It's (Trump voice) YUGE!  If I manage to finish the steak, I'm hurting.  Meat sweats type hurting...  Best to share.\n",

It was easy and I didn't have to sign up for any additional stuff. Big ups right there. I even received a confirmation email the night before (although I had already called to confirm the reservation).\n",
      "\n",
      "Our server name? Michael Jackson. He didn't moonwalk for us but it was probably the best single display of customer service in a restaurant that I've ever had the pleasure of dining in. He was engaging, attentive, and even dropping \"kama'aina\" and a few other Pidgin words upon realizing all of us were sitting there in our Sig Zane's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sig-zane-designs-hilo).\n",
      "\n",
      "We actually started with a small sampler platter that was given to us on the house because we were with our friends who lived there. I guess they like to encourage Las Vegas locals to come down more often. It was juicy because of the veggies on top, but the meat was a bit crisp and even more on the burnt side for me. After that we ordered the Truffle Oil and Parmesan Potato Chips and Emeril's signature cajun New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp appetizers. The potato chips were highly addictive and had a super rich flavor to them. Add the Parmesan and the saltiness was of great compliment. One of the many highlights to the evening was the shrimp appetizer. The large shrimp were wonderfully crafted with just the right amount of spices to encourage their fresh sweetness to linger.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the special Bone in Rib Eye Steak. It was perfectly cooked to medium. The thing was pretty large and I finished off most of it, but coupled with everything else we ordered, it was a tall task. My good friend ordered the Filet Mignon Medallions and they were spectacularly juicy and flavorful. I actually secretly wished I had ordered that instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ours sides consisted of Potato Gratin, caramelized Seasonal Onions, and Creamed Corn Gratinee. They all were excellent in their own right. My friend described the Potato Gratin as the single best dish of Potato Gratin he has ever had. Myself, I thought that the Seasonal Onions were spectacularly sweet. They blew my mind and I almost loaded up on those alone. The Corn Gratinee was also sweet, but it wasn't as good as the other two. Although, two spectacular sides out of three isn't too shabby.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it was a great spending time with good friends over an excellent meal in addition to the wonderful service. It was worth every expensive penny I could slam on the credit card. I would easily recommend to anyone the experience. Reservations are highly recommended. One last note, we even got a hand-written thank you postcard less than a week later from Michael. That was really nice.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This is probably my favorite steakhouse.i ordered the filet mignon and it was great. Very nice staff, great, professional, high quality service! Only downside is that the dining room feels a little cramped, tables are close and pretty noisy.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Hard to write this review because I will say my rib eye steak was done to perfection. Well-seasoned, cooked perfectly. Tender and flavorful meat. That's where the compliments stop. We also ordered a side of broccoli to share and some au gratin potatoes. The broccoli at $9 was just horrifying. It's all the reasons that children don't want to eat their vegetables. I think it started with an awful product. The broccoli itself was not only lacking in freshness, it was limp and flavorless. It could not have been good broccoli to begin with. It seemed as if it was frozen and then heated up slightly as it was mushy. It was also underwhelming with seasoning of any sort. Surprising from a restaurant of this caliber. Why bother selling broccoli when it was so disgusting. The au gratin potatoes were good. These at least had salt and were not overly cheesy. I give them a B.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for service, it was OK. I realize hard to do good service with large parties. I will tell you that even though the server made up for it in the end, there was a big problem. I ordered a side of foie gras. It appeared on the table in front of me and then at some point in the service, someone from the wait staff came over and took it away from me so quickly, I didn't even have a chance to ask about it. Perplexed, I asked our server. He apologized and tried to get a new order on my table asap and he took it off the bill.  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend the foie that came to me. It was cold in the middle and uninteresting. Let me tell you that cold foie is not good. Disappointing on all fronts.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Had the pleasure of dining at this establishment recently and have to say the food and service was above par. My Fiance got the Japanese Wagyu Ribeye steak and said it was the most delectable steak he has had the privilege of tasting. I had the Filet Mignon and it was cooked perfectly. I would definitely come back for any special event or for a great steak.\n",

      "On our girls-weekend to Vegas, one gal requested at least one nice steak dinner.  So we did some research and ended up here.  Seated promptly at our reservation time on a Friday night after sitting only a few minutes in their version of a waiting room.\n",
      "As others have mentioned, when you order a steak ... that's what you get.  Not a piece of parsley to garnish, nothin' else is on that plate.  Our lil steak girl said her $45 steak was .... ok.  But, and I quote, she'd had a steak with more flavor at a certain Aussie steak chain.  Girl who ordered the chicken dish loved it and said it was worth the money.  The $9 side of mashed potatoes was yummy.  Little veg here ordered their vegetable plate (not on the menu, but when I asked what was available, our waiter offered this) and it cost me $30.  For grilled veggies - carrots, two types of onion, asparagus, and .... something else.  Not even squash!  A squash ravioli was on the menu, but not being served that night.\n",
      "Loud, no bathroom inside (have to walk around the corner in the casino), and there was NO decor to the place.  Maybe that's a style, but it ain't mine.\n",
      "The wine list is waaay extensive, almost to a fault.\n",
      "Service was overwhelming in that we had four separate waiters, but chaotic.  And it was 40 minutes from ordering to getting our food.\n",
      "Last complaint - if you have a nice restaurant, insist on some kind of basic dresscode.  I don't want to have spent time looking nice and then sit next to a table full of rednecks in Tasmanian Devil cartoon shirts.\n",
      "Sorry, but it isn't worth the money for herbivores or carnivores.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I had better expectations for this place based on the reviews.  I ordered the bone in ribeye, which was touted as their \"signature dish\".  The meat was not well marbled and was quite gristly for the price.  The quality of meat was comparable to an Outback or Black Angus.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Quite possibly, the best steak I ever had.  Went here with my wife and made sure I had reservations.  We were seated promptly upon arrival.  The rolls were delicious, as they are in all of Emeril's restaurants.  Ordered the Lobster Bisque soup, which was incredible.  The large pieces of lobster inside the soup just made it all that much better.  I ordered the bone-in ribeye and my wife ordered the filet.  Both steaks were cooked perfectly and were extremely tender.  We also enjoyed the twice baked potato with our meal.  For dessert, we had to have the Banana Cream Pie.  It was absolutely fabulous.  It had chocolate shavings drizzled on top and caramel sauce on the plate.  This is not your ordinary piece of pie.  It was absolutely heaven.  We had a fantastic meal, just like we have at Emeril's other restaurants.  The service was excellent and the staff was very friendly.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This is my favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas, bar none. You can always count on Emeril Lagasse to deliver on his good name. We were in town for my fiance's birthday, so I jumped at the chance to make a reservation at Delmonico. \n",
      "\n",

      "I started with the lobster bisque. Creamy, hot, and with chunks of tender lobster aplenty. So flavorful, I chose to pass on the offer of fresh ground pepper. An A+ app. \n",
      "\n",
      "On to main course. I had the boneless rib eye steak. I LOVED that the waiter asked me to cut into it in front of him to be sure it was prepared to my liking, and it was perfect! Upon the first bite, time stood still. I could think of nothing but how delicious the bite in my mouth was, and how I could not wait to demolish the easily 12oz. piece of heaven in front of me. The meat had a juiciness and flavor that even the most discerning of carnivore would have to admit was the best ever. \n",
      "\n",
      "The fiancee had the Grilled Filet Medallions, wild mushroom crusted with Emeril's Worcestershire sauce, house cured bacon, and Parmesan cheese. I, of course, had to have a taste of these fantastic looking medallions, and they were stellar. I especially liked the play between the slightly sweet of the Worcestershire and the savory of the meat and Parmesan crust. Also an awesome dish. \n",

      "Due to the healthy portions, there was no room for dessert. We were given a sorbet on the house that was very tangy, a raspberry I believe... \n",

I chose the restaurant based on location (I'm staying at the Venetian) and, of course, the menu.  There were several items that looked delicious, and each of my choices was outstanding. \n",
      "\n",
      "To start, the service was excellent. I had three servers, and my iced tea was always full. When I let the server know this was my first time visiting, he brought out a small plate with two bite-sized, yummy appetizers. I chose the prix fixe menu, starting with the beef carpaccio. The carpaccio with the crispy capers and garlic emulsion melted in my mouth.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For the main course, I had the recommended Emeril's BBQ salmon.  I chose medium rare, and it was cooked to perfection.  The sauce was great, and I loved the onions on top.\n",

      "Desert was pecan pie with an incredible oatmeal shortbread crust.  I would probably order it without the whipped cream as it wasn't needed with the vanilla ice cream, but I wish I could have the pecan pie every day. Scrumptious! \n",

      "It's not a cheap dinner, but the atmosphere, service and menu make it well worth it for a nice dinner out.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] With all due respect to other Steak places in Vegas, Delmonico knocks it out of the park! The bone in ribeye (Delmonico), cream corn, cream spinach, potatoes gratin, even the mixed greens salad were fantastic! The banana cream pie and even the quality of coffee were above par. Our waiter Michael and his co-staff were great. We have a now a total of three great experiences at Delmonico. Is it expensive, well isn't everything in Vegas? It is a must every time we're in Vegas.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This is part of my steak house reviews for Las Vegas. Delmonico's is a premier steak place. The staff is top notch and make you feel at home even though it is a high end steak joint. We were there for a bachelor party.  all of us tried varieties of different cuts. The filet and ribeye were phenomenal. The side selection was not as good as some other steak places I've been too, however it was still good. The only drawback and it was a minor one, was we had a vegan with us. His chef's creation was substandard for a place this cutting edge.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Went for a nice anniversary dinner. Researched a lot of steakhouses and thought this was reasonably priced (compared to others) for Vegas so thought we'd give it a shot. made reservations but was not crowded on a Monday night. We split the bbq shrimp which were very good for an appetizer. Then we each had salads. I ordered the filet mignon which was a small 6oz serving for $50. I could've easily eaten 2 of them. But the steak was very tender and nicely seasoned. Husband had the bone in ribeye which is what they are known for. He enjoyed it. We split the mashed potatoes which were very good, but kinda hard to screw those up. We each had 1 drink and the bill was $200. Service was good. They give you nice warm rolls which were tasty. We would go back, but we like trying new places and it will probably be a few years before we go back to Vegas anyways.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Let me begin by saying WOW!!!! My wife and I both had the Filet Mignon. Hers was prepared medium/well with a baked potato. Mine was prepared medium/rare oscar style.  The steaks were cooked to perfection.  The service was exceptional.  We have eaten at some of the best steakhouses in the country.  We now have a new standard to measure against.  For years we have used Berns Steakhouse in Tampa as our golden rule.  In terms of overall service, food, and atmosphere Delmonico has risen to the top of the list.  My advice, don't throw away all of your money at the casino; slow down for a moment and enjoy a great dinner at Delmonico.  It is one thing when you leave Vegas that you will not be sorry for.\n",

      "\n",
      "Tuna & Salmon Tartare - very fresh tuna & salmon tartare, each delicately seasoned, with a bit of wasabi sauce & seaweed salad in between.  A lightly dressed cucumber and red onion salad with the tiniest seasame seeds sprinkled on top added a nice vinegary element.  And crunchy wonton chips were perfect to scoop up everything with.  Great texture & flavor!\n",
      "\n",
      "Bone In Ribeye - a seared perfectly, served medium rare, herb butter topped, giant steak.  Classic.  Awesome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Applewood Smoked Double Cut Kurobuta Ham Chop - I'm not a big fan of pork so if I say that I loved this, it's a BIG deal.  This double cut chop had seared, caramelized, fatty edges, and was perfectly seasoned.  This was THE juiciest pork chop I've ever had.  Served with pecan-topped, candied sweet potatoes that are a MUST eat with the chop, & a cider reduction.  The combination of savory, sweet, buttery, meaty, pecan-y, brown sugary, and slightly hammy flavors together were amazing.  Emeril knows his pork!\n",
      "\n",
      "Wild Mushrooms - a generous mess of delicious mixed mushrooms.  Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Banana Cream Pie - a ridiculously impressive-looking presentation, crazy tall!  Thin & slightly salty crispy graham crust, tons of freshly sliced bananas, able to reach such heights because the pudding was more cheesecake-y texture & acted as banana mortar.  Topped with fresh whipped cream, a drizzle of caramel, & a few chocolate shavings.  You'd have to be crazy to attempt to eat this alone!\n",
      "\n",
      "This was definitely a dinner to remember, and that ham chop is something to spread the word about.  Get it!\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I had a late-ish dinner around 9 here on Friday the 28th of July after seeing Phantom at the Venetian because the restaurant was close to the theater. I noticed there was a piano in the waiting room but no one was playing it; instead they were blasting the sportscast on the TV which soured the mood. Once seated the atmosphere was largely pleasant but also a bit too loud and some of the staff seemed uncertain and nervous. Our head server in particular was not enjoying himself at all and was visibly annoyed by the group across from our table which was loitering around the restaurant for a long time after finishing their meal. \n",
      "\n",
      "The meal itself was very good, especially my Bone-in-Ribeye which is their signature cut. It's a slightly glazed and massive piece of meat, rubbed with a Cajun sauce that gave it zest and even a bit of spice. It paired beautifully with the Bourbon-Bacon Manhattan I ordered at the bar. My dining companion had the New York strip which was fine but not nearly as memorable as the Bone-in. Like the cuts of the meat, the sides are probably too big and one side is more than enough for 2 people. However both of the sides we had (The Wild Mushrooms and the Spinach) were delicious so it would be difficult to pick one. The appetizers were relatively standard, with the exception of the Parmesan-Truffle Chips but be forewarned that delicious as they are they are very filling and quite greasy.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Wow, first time. Only place I'd put on Ruth Chris ribeye level. The creamed corn with the bread crumb crust served warm in a pan. Delicious. Asparagus was cooked nicely but bland. Iceberg wedge was good, could easily be shared. Service was perfect. Environment is a little generic and mass market like and a little loud. Large leather Seats are comfy but you really need to be 6ft plus to eat at the table easily. This is the spot for a good ribeye and some yummy creamed corn, hands down.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Deserves a zero. I was highly disappointed. We went for my husband's birthday expecting a meal worthy of the $200 we spent.  The food was very bland. I was so upset I didn't even bother to order dessert.  I thought if dessert tastes anything like dinner, I'm not going to bother. Noone bothered to ask how the food was. The chef didn't bother to come to our table,  even though he spoke to individuals at the three other tables surrounding us. Thank God I opted for the indoor gondola ride after dinner which helped to improve my mood for the evening.  I won't be back here or to any of his restaurants. I'm a good person so I still left a very generous tip;  after all it wasn't the waiter's fault the food was just ok.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Great meal!  Went for lunch and had the truffle potato chips, Caesar salad, lobster sliders, filet medallions and prime burger.  Topped it off with the pecan pie (spectacular) and peppermint chocolate layer cake.  Service was outstanding as well - what a great group from start to finish.  And thanks so much for the surprise pop-overs in our to-go bag!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Excellent and very attentive wait staff. The food was nicely executed, but I just was not impressed with my ribeye steak. I ordered it medium rare and found it to be on the dry side. It was also not that hot, same goes for my baked potato. My main entree could have been  served hotter, but I guess since we were in a large group, our food just ended up that way. \n",
      "\n",
      "I really liked the spinach & frisée salad, tuna & salmon tartare, and the creme brûlée was very good. The raspberry sorbet was bland and didn't taste that flavorful.\n",

It's like magic.  Before you even have a chance to THINK it, it happens on its own.  The food in an of itself is DELECTABLE.

      "I don't remember much about any of the sides because I'm always too busy gobbling up my steak (and still having leftovers to go!).  Many a late Las Vegas night, I'd drunkenly stumble back into my hotel room, and suddenly overcome by an urge to grub, grab my takeout box and just CHEW on a slab of leftover steak.  It's even good cold.\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Another great steakhouse in Las Vegas (I think almost all of them are great, and it all depends on what style you are looking for). This is a chain restaurant so some might be skeptical, but overall I think this is one of the better restaurants of the chain (as I have been to several of the Delmonico restaurants). The service was great as usual and for the price point of the steak, I think one of the more affordable steakhouses in Las Vegas for what you get. \n",
      "\n",
      "The bone-in rib eye - cooked to perfect medium rare and the one thing that Delmonico's adds to their steaks is a big chunk of herb butter that just adds so much more flavor to the steak (although you know its bad for you, you just want more!). \n",
      "\n",
      "Sides - great for sharing and we had the mixed mushrooms, creamed spinach and creamed corn. Not the best sides that I've had, but they were good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, a great option for a steakhouse in The Venetian and in Las Vegas.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] where to start....\n",
      "Had a party of 4. Started with the Lobster Bisque soup, was a little too salty, but was tasted pretty good. With the main meal it took a while to get and when we got it, the steak that i had ordered ~medium~ was more like extra rare still kicking, and after taking the first bite out of it, it was already luke warm. After telling the waiter about the steak he took it and brought it back, medium rare, still bloody. I didn't think it was possible to mess up on a steak twice in a row, but oh well. The side dish's were asparagus, garlic mashed potatoes, spinach, and garlic mushroom. Just like the steak it got cold too fast, as well as the side dish's, however the garlic mashed potatoes, and the mushrooms were good while they were warm. The spinach would have tasted better if it had come from a can and the asparagus was nothing special, just expensive asparagus!\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall:\n",
      "The food needs to be served on hot plates!\n",
      "The service was awesome, and that was probably the best quality of the restaurant.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Perhaps one of the best meals I have had! Service was excellent and very attentive. The petite rib-eye with bacon wrapped shrimp, garlic mashed potatoes with a sweet tomato reduction was more than excellent! The appetizer of ahi tuna and salmon tar tar was very tasty as well. My husband had told them that we were celebrating my birthday prior to our arrival. They didn't make a big fuss, but greeted us with a yummy mini-mushroom tart to start our meal and ended it with a creamy cheese cake and wished me a happy birthday in a very descrete way :-)  -- I'm not one for loud signing and being the center of attention.  Delmonico's is a very nice, classy place. We will be back for sure!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] You know you're growing up when you spend a weekend in Vegas and don't hit the clubs but fancy restaurants. It's a bittersweet feeling. CUT has been my absolute favorite place for steak and fine dining for the past five years but we decided to try somewhere new for once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food (4): The food was great but I wasn't blown away. I didn't leave the restaurant replaying every bite. We ordered the heirloom tomato soup (with grilled cheese sandwich), mac and cheese, crab legs, and two steaks. I got the special steak of the day that came with shaved pieces of truffle on top. Don't get me wrong. Everything was delicious and I had no problem with my food, but it just wasn't memorable. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ambiance (3.5): It's a fancy restaurant but felt like any other bougie restaurant inside of a Vegas hotel. We were seated at a corner table but there definitely could have been some more space between us and the pair next to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service (4): Service was also a positive experience. Our waiter was pleasant and friendly and made small talk with us. And when my date found a long curly hair mixed into his crab legs, the waiter apologized and took it back without a second thought. When he came back with a new plate the legs looked like they came from the fattest crabs possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "So overall, a wonderful experience and I would have no qualms about returning. But CUT remains my favorite steak restaurant.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The service is excellent.  The food quality is good but everything was very salty. We had the lobster, flounder, lobster bisque, tomato salad etc.  All those dishes were salty.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Almost done catching up with my reviews. Here is my last one for tonight. After going to Carnevino the night before, Delmonicos kind of took the back seat for me. However, we were with a big group and everyone else loved the food. Bone in rib eye, tenderloin medalions, sirloin, to lamb we had everything on the table. Absolutely no complaints about the food. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, we were seated kind of in the corner round table which was fine but some of us were facing a glass enclosed small room that had stacks of chairs. What is that room? Was it seriously storage space we were starring at? I didn't expect to see a stack of black chairs in a glass case room throughout my whole dinner from a high end restaurant. \n",
      "\n",
      "Coming from a delicous dessert finish with Afrogato the night before, I asked the waitress if it could be made. She said sure it could. I was very excited only to realize when the bill came that she charged $8 for a shot of Espresso and $10 for scoop of ice cream. WOW.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Hands down the best steak I've ever had, the bone in ribeye was amazing! I loved the garlic mushrooms and the twice baked potatoes too. Not only was the food perfect but the service was phenomenal. My friends and I popped in off the street with no reservation and not dressed up at all. Even though we completely stood out, we were shown to out seats immediately and we didn't get one dirty look from any of our 3 waiters!  I will return to vegas in the future if only to eat here again!!!!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We returned to Vegas to celebrate my wife and my 15th wedding anniversary.  We chose to go to Delmonico Steakhouse because when we first began dating our first real date was at Emeril's in Vegas.  We booked a reservation via open table for 5 pm, we arrived around 4:30 and was told they would begin seating at 5 and we could wait in their lounge area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our servers were Ryan and Anthony and they did a spectacular job making us feel welcome and catering to our needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the bone in Rib Eye and my wife ordered the Rack of Lamb both were dialectic and cooked how we ordered them. We also had the creamed spinach and fingerling potatoes.  The creamed spinach was very good.\n",
      "\n",
      "To top it off because I had mentioned it being our anniversary on OpenTable when I booked the reservation we were surprised to receive a special little tasting to begin our dining experience and a scoup of their chocolate gellato for dessert.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall it was a great evening to remember.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Steakhouses are a dime a dozen in Las Vegas- every resort has one, and with a few exceptions, they're generally pretty good. \n",
      "\n",
      "My experience at Delmonico was one of those exceptions.  Three of us celebrating St Patrick's Day, March Madness, and 40th birthdays all rolled into one weekend, decided to enjoy a dinner at Delmonico's.  \n",
      "\n",
      "From the moment we checked in, fantastic service.  Our server, Michael, was gracious, professional, funny, and more than willing to tolerate and participate in our banter, but never in an obtrusive way.  The food was outstanding- the ribeye was perfectly cooked, and the creamed corn gratin was downright amazing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Great wine selection, excellent service (have I mentioned the service), and a great pecan pie with some glasses of port.  This was a great dinner, and an experience I will appreciate for a long time, and worth every penny of the $200 per head that we paid.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Why not 5 stars?  Because even though the food was amazing, I think it was a little too pricey for what they offer.  I was there for a work dinner, and I didn't have to pay for it.. but I sure feel sorry for our vendor that did.  It was a very expensive meal for the 5 of us. \n",
      "\n",
      "Don't get me wrong.  I had the BEST (sorry Tam o Shanter) steak I've ever put in my mouth here.  I got the bone OUT rib eye, covered with melty bleu cheese chunks.  I ate the whole thing by myself, which I thought was pretty impressive, because I've never even SEEN a piece of meat that big in my whole life.  Let alone that big on a plate to eat. But size aside, the steak knife almost literally fell through the steak once you started the cut.  I always thought the metaphor of red meat melting in your mouth was a little dramatic, but it really happened.  Repeatedly.  So delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also had the BBQ Shrimp appetizer, which wasn't what I expected BBQ Shrimp to be, but still really amazing.  It wasn't actually BBQ'd I don't think, but cooked and covered in BBQ sauce that was really tasty.  Not too smokey, not too tangy, not too sweet.  Just enough BAM!  OMG I'm sorry, I had to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found the creamed spinach to be a little bland and lacking, which was disappointing, because the creamed spinach I had the day before at The Palm was fantastic. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also had creme brulee for dessert, which is my favorite and really hard to do wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "A great bottle of red wine as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The multiple servers were very friendly, very polite and very helpful and funny.  I found them all to be very accommodating and well trained.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am saving up to come back on my own the next time I go to Vegas. Yummy.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Steak was very tough. Surprising for $55.00, I had the Ribeye and my son had the NY strip. Both the same. Flavor was unusual. Atmosphere was good roll's were spectacular and twice baked potato was also very good. Overall would not return.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] One of the best steaks of my life! We were there May of 2014. We had to modify our reservation as we were running late and they were able to accommodate us around 830pm. They served this little puff bread with butter and it literally melted in my mouth. I have been dreaming of those since then! I chose the ribeye and my boyfriend chose the new york steak. Both steaks were seared to perfection! I chose mashed potatoes which was delicious but my boyfriend got the fingerling potatoes which were to DIE FOR. the herbs it simmered in was mouth watering! We were even impressed when they delivered a complimentary melon sorbet with happy anniversary written in chocolate. It was a delicious delight and we cant wait to go back again!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I've been to Delmonico a couple times, and it has been good both times. \n",
      "Everything was pretty tasty, but I can't say there was anything in particular that wowed me. Actually, I take that back... there is a banana dessert that is absolutely spectacular. But that's not really enough to make me excited about returning here.\n",
      "The service is consistently very good. I think I'm just not a fan of the decor and ambiance here. It's great for a business lunch, but I would never choose Delmonico for a romantic dinner or night out with friends. The interior is just really boring.\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My experience at Delmonico Steakhouse was well-above average, but not as fantastic as I thought it would be.  First off, although we had made reservations well in advance, we had to wait over 20 minutes for our table.  All was not completely lost, however, since we passed the time in Delmonico's classy little, modish bar area where we got started on our red wine for the evening. \n",
      "\n",
      "There was a bit of confusion amongst the servers shortly after we were seated, and we experienced a delay in receiving our selection of bottled waters for our table.  At Delmonico, they give you the option of choosing from a few types of bottled and mineral waters for an additional charge, or you can request just regular,complimentary tap water. After the initial delay, our water glasses were refilled continuously throughout the meal, however. \n",
      "\n",
      "Like most five star restaurants, at Delmonico Steakhouse, you receive service from several members of the waitstaff, which ensures constant attention and most of your dining needs are met without even having to request anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interior of the steakhouse was minimalist, with tables covered in cream colored linens and simple, modern brown leather chairs for seating. The space had a slightly Mediterranean feel due to its coved ceilings.  No doubt because the restaurant is located inside the Venetian Hotel, they wanted to maintain a slightly Italian theme througout. \n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant, which was was packed with patrons, was also very loud.  I think the coved ceilings were extremely conducive to the noise level contained in the dining room.  This combined with brighter than desired lighting, created a slightly less intimate dining experience than were were anticipating.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The food was very good, however.  We started with the crabcake, and it was tender, buttery and delicious.  Followed by that, were our iceberg wedge salads with bacon, blue cheese and all the yummies.  Hubby ordered the bone-in ribeye, and I ordered the bone-in NY strip, both were cooked to medium perfection.  For sides, we shared a huge, delicious baked potato with sour cream, bacon, green onions and cheddar. For dessert, we shared the caramel creme brulee, and it was very, very good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, we enjoyed our meal very much, and we would return here again for the food.  Our experience was just was not over-the-top fabulous because of the noise and lighting factors.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We ate a very quiet lunch at Delmonico's on a Monday afternoon -- just a handful of other tables at 1:00 pm.  I love going to steak houses at lunch - - you usually get a great meal at a reasonable price.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the deconstructed steak salad -- delicious.  Medium rare with blue cheese.  Yum.  Hub's had the Lobster Sliders -- divine. We each had a glass of wine, so it was an $80 lunch, with tip.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service was spotty.  The assistant waiter was great, but our lead waiter was very distracted and barely attended the table.  When asked about simple wine questions (what blend was the Emeril Red), had to defer to the FoH manager.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will go back -- love Delmonico's here & in NOLA.  I've never been disappointed at any restaurant run by Emeril.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The excellent: 1) Waiter Frank was very helpful and personable and was dead-on with food recommendations! 2) the barbeque shrimp was the highlight of the meal; its sauce was so flavorful and a definite must-get item! 3) very nice touch of congratulatory dish written in chocolate and complementary dessert! The bad: we received NY strips instead of rib-eyes and steak not impressive at all; did not taste like it was a prime cut - too lean and very little flavor, although foie gras was cooked perfectly. Restaurant touts of 7 week aged beef but couldn't tell - have had more flavorful steaks from Costco. Won't go here again because of the unimpressive steak quality, even though service, ambiance, and appetizer was excellent.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My boyfriend and I dined at Delmonico's on a trip to Vegas  in July 2013 - for dinner on the 4th of July.  The restaurant we had originally planned to go to that night was completely booked, so based on the great Yelp rating we chose Delmonico's instead.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Prior to our trip, we were so excited to try this place out.  Our reservations were at 8pm and we showed up a few minutes early, expecting the place to be packed.  I should mention that the location is very odd and not easy to find.  However, once we found it we started wondering if we were  in the right place...  Both of us have dined in nice steakhouses many times and expected that familiar 5 star experience.  From the second we walked in the door it was clear that Delmonico's was not that kind of place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The entrance was very dark - no one was at the hostess stand and the bar/lounge area was completely empty.  The restaurant looked closed.   Then, the hostess showed up with another employee - they finished their casual, not work related, conversation before greeting us.  They looked up our reservation and sat us right away so I was ready to let go of my first impression and enjoy a great meal.  Unfortunately, that was just the start.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The hostess led us into a mostly empty room with very dim lighting.  We thought it was weird but went along with it.  As we sat down, we realized that the only other table in the room was a large party with serval children - who were playing games and watching movies on their iPads! We were shocked that this behavior was allowed in such a place.  We looked into the other dining room which was mostly full and seemed very lively, full of adults.  When our waiter came over we asked to move to that room (pointing out the distractions at the other table), which they accommodated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally in the environment we were hoping for, we felt relieved as our new waiter handed us a wine list.  The waiter brought the wine and as he poured the glasses, he spilled an entire glass in front of me, on the table.  Did he find us a new table? Did he bring a new (full) bottle of wine? No. Instead he picked the glass up and continued pouring and brought a white napkin to place in front of me to cover the wine stained/wet area.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, we considered leaving but it was past 8:30 and we wanted to try the steak, so we stayed.  We ordered the table side Caesar salad and the chateaubriand to split.  The salad was the highlight of the meal - if you go here, make sure to order it.  The steak was ok, slightly undercooked and we have definitely had better.  After the meal, we decided to skip desert here and go upstairs to Otto instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did use the restroom during the meal.  This was another disappointment.  The restrooms are located down a long hallway, which was also where they stored the extra chairs (stacks of them).  You felt like you were in an area of the restaurant that shouldn't be customer facing - cluttered, scuffs all over the walls and baseboards. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the experience at Delmonico's was anything but 5 star.  With so many wonderful restaurants in vegas at this price point, there is no reason to choose Delmonico's.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] OHH.... ohhhhhhh.... omg. \n",

Actually, I was shellshocked at the great service... most pricey restaurants are pretty snooty, but the peeps @ Delmonico were warm and super attentive.\n",

The thing was huge and ex-roomie and I actually shared it (with Andre sweetly saying that it was not a problem) and it was STILL too much. Had my steak been anything but spectacular, I would have been mortified at the shenanigans. Instead, I swiped some artichoke spears (crisp, fresh and awesome) & truffle potato chips (a little greasy but OMG, so good)  from the other ladies and dug into the side we ordered, which was the potato au gratin (again, a little heavy but OHHH... so amazingly tasty... my favorite side dish!) \n",

What you'll find is a variety of food selections with Creole influences. \n",
      "\n",
      "First the menu prices are expensive ($$$$) but you are there for the intimate and fine dining experience and should be expecting to pay those prices.  What I didn't expect was to be dressed up and have an individual in shorts, sandals, and a Baltimore Colts jersey seated at an adjacent table to me.  Kind of lowered my view of this establishment being world class if you know what I mean.\n",
      "\n",
      "I started with the Lobster Bisque which was just superb but did lack the \"Creole\" twist I was expecting (The BAM factor).  Only thing that was a little of an inconvenience was the lobster pieces were quite large and were hard to cut with my spoon.  The wife selected the Organic Baby Mixed Greens Salad Creole Spiced Croutons, Sherry Vinaigrette, Shaved Manchego Cheese Roasted Teardrop Tomatoes and Shaved Red Onion.  I had a taste and it was very good.  The different flavors were unique and distinctive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main course I selected a Pinot Noir wine that to go along with my Ribeye Steak and selected the Roasted Fingerling Potatoes and Whole Garlic with Fresh Herbs.  The wine was fantastic with a rich and bold body and floral aroma.  Wasn't dry and complimented the Ribeye Steak very well.  The Ribeye has Emeril's classic touch written all over it with the blackened spice rub with a pat of herb butter on top.  The cut was 1-1/2 inches thick, lean, and very large portion.  The potato dish was okay, didn't impress me in any way.  The wife also had the Pinot Noir and selected the Filet Mignon.  The cut had to be nearly 2 inches thick, lean, and a normal portion size.  I recommend selecting your Ribeye to be cooked medium rare (I do not recommend medium) and your Filet Mignon medium rare or at the most medium.  \n",

      "Started with french onion soup...steakhouse staple right? Wrong...it didn't have much flavor and was pretty one dimensional. Limp, flaccid, no flavor onions.\n",

      "My steak...prime, dry-aged rib-eye on the bone. After being schooled by the waiter on how \"they cook their steaks\" and what medium rare means. I get a medium well steak instead of the medium rare that i ordered. What a waste of a good piece of meat or at least I assume it was before they over-cooked it.\n",

This place is almost always five stars for me but this last visit I made then mistake and deviated from my normal order of filet mignon and did the surf and turf special instead. The lobster was good (not sure if I would say amazing since it was slathered in bearnaise sauce) but the steak was only so-so; not up to normal Delmonico quality. Covering it in the amazing house steak sauce did help but I wouldn't recommend ordering the surf and turf.\n",

      "Whether you're visiting Delmonico on a regular night, special occasion, or during Restaurant Week as I did, from the amazing lunch I had with extraordinary service and exceptional food, I'd recommend it to anyone. 4.5 stars at least.\n",
      "\n",
      "We seem to be the first party seated for lunch. Our two servers worked well together, being knowledgeable, catering, and attentive from beginning to end. Even as more customers started to come in and they had more to attend to, they still did an amazing job making sure we were taken care of.\n",
      "\n",
      "What we put in our tummies:\n",
      "(pictures posted)\n",
      "\n",
      "1st Course\n",
      "Traditional New Orleans\n",
      "Chicken & Andouille Sausage Gumbo\n",
      "\n",
      "2nd Course\n",
      "Butternut Squash Ravioli\n",
      "Prime Cheeseburger w/ Bacon\n",
      "\n",
      "3rd Course\n",
      "Emeril's Banana Cream Pie\n",
      "Pecan Pie\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm no expert on gumbo, but I found it very tasty. Still steaming in individual serving pots, it was poured over rice table-side. Very nice touch. The burger was an enormous 11oz, well-seasoned, cooked medium as requested, hearty and meaty as burgers should be. Fries were just...fries. It was my first experience with butternut squash ravioli, and I loved it. Sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts, and parmesan cheese made these raviolis sweet and flavorful.\n",
      "\n",
      "The highlight of the food was unquestionably the desserts. I never order banana cream pie, but I'm a big believer in trying whatever is the signature item, especially when it's written \"Emeril's Banana Cream Pie.\" I'm sure it's not made very traditionally, but OH MY GOSH. Made with sweet bananas, the pie filling felt more like a cheesecake. Topped with chocolate shavings, amazing crust, this dessert will be what I think of from this day forward when anyone says banana cream pie. You think the way I described it, how could the pecan pie even compete?! Well, it did! Served warm and moist, it was decadent and comforting.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was beginning to wonder if the Restaurant Week event and menus were affecting my experiences at these places I've been eagerly wanting to try. I was very excited to participate, awaiting delicious gourmet food at a great price at a fine-dining establishment, helping a worthy cause. \n",
      "\n",
      "Personally, I'm very happy to say Delmonico made me want to become a repeat customer, again and again. It's so hard not to give 5 stars, but I would want to experience dining here on a non-Restaurant Week to confidently say it was as amazing as I remembered this lunch. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm very much looking forward to coming back. And soon!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Decided to try lunch today. I have had the Rib Steak and I loved it. Today I had the lunch steak sandwich. I have to admit it was extremely tasty. My friend had the lobster sliders and she said they were awesome.  The service was great..mind you the restaurant was not overly busy.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Probably one of the best meals and service I have ever experienced. They operate on a team-style of service, though our main server, I believe his name was Mike was fantastic. Started a little slow, but we went above and beyond my expectations! Started with a bottle of champagne and then a bottle of red with dinner. They keep the bottles for you off the table, so you never pour on your own and your drink is never empty. Though we may have over-ordered the table-side Caesar and table-side chateaubriand were phenomenal. Perfectly prepared and delicious. I could not have enjoyed myself more! Thank you for an amazing date night in Vegas!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Wow, what a huge disappointment, considering how expensive the entrees are!\n",
      "\n",
      "My girlfriends and I were totally famished when we got into Vegas, thank goodness we had made reservations beforehand. We didn't wait long and had a drink in the lounge as we waited to be seated.\n",
      "\n",
      "After browsing the menu, my friend and I decided to split the bone-in ribeye, medium well. Our server says it's their house specialty. The steak was completely blackened from the char and the inside was perfectly done. As I cut into it with my knife, I can tell it's going to be chewy....and indeed it was. It had almost no flavor for a dry aged meat. My friend had to ask for steak sauce and sour cream to make it more flavorful.\n",
      "\n",
      "BUT, the sides we ordered (potato gratin and creamed corn) were awesome! AND my friend's filet mignon was the most tender I've ever had (she gave me some of hers)\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was impeccable and friendly...but the food (at least what I ate) was not worth $52 for a steak.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My experience at Delmonico was fabulous in every way. Service (especially with my large group) was superb. My last visit was my second time dining here. I must say, both of my visits have been an outstanding five-star dining extravaganza. \n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant was bustling for the Global Gaming Expo this past fall. We had reservations and were seated right away at a large table to accommodate our group of 9 guests. We were seated off the main dining room in a dimply lit secluded area that helped enhanced conversation and provided a more intimate dining experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "We were promptly served our craft cocktails and wine as we browsed the menu for our dinner options. We all had a really tough time deciding on the dishes since everything looked and sounded incredible. Out waitress was on top of her game and cheerfully provided her recommendations to the group.  We ended up ordering a mix of entrees/ sides/ starters/ cocktails/ wine and sweets including a handful of Bone-In Rib-eyes (check out the photo- holy guacamole..) Bone-In NY Strips, Twice Baked Potatoes, Asparagus, Wild Mushrooms, Potato Au Gratin, Lobster Bisque, Wedge Salads with blue cheese crumbles, Banana Cream Pie, and coffee to top it off. \n",
      "\n",
      "My guests and I were blown away by the food and service experience. Our favorite dish of the night was, you guessed it, the Bone-In Rib-eye steaks. They were seasoned perfectly with an awesome rub with hints of Cajun inspiration and topped with dab of butter. Yum. It is the best steak I've had to date. Simply divine! \n",
      "\n",
      "The sides were large and intended to be shared and passed. We enjoyed the classic steak and potato combos and broke it up with some mixed green salads, asparagus and mushrooms. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted heavenly. We stuffed ourselves in a Thanksgiving fashion and had a wonderful and memorable evening. \n",
      "\n",
      "I will undoubtedly be returning for another amazing experience in the future! Kudos to the entire staff for making this an amazing dining experience!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Came here for thanksgiving dinner. The place is nice, spacious, classy, definitely serve the older crowd/family scene. Food was good, nothing to complain about but nothing that WOW-ed us. Although i must say the steak tartare was awesome!\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing to note, i didn't like the fact that the servers/hostess looked at my bf and i like we can't afford this or something, not sure if it's because we are young couple. It just have that weird/uncomfortable feelings. We were well-dressed and have the proper table ,manners etc. Weird feelings. (i still give it 4 star for the service and food though)\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I'm still dreaming about this meal. We don't often spend this kind of money on a dinner out, but this was a special night out in Vegas, so why not? Let me tell you, it was worth every penny. \n",
      "\n",
      "Top items include:\n",
      "Delmonico cocktail. It was heaven, but I love gin and grapefruit and it was a perfect mix. \n",
      "\n",
      "The truffle chips. Oh my goodness they were so good. \n",
      "\n",
      "The steak my husband ordered melted in your mouth. It was perfectly cooked to order and had fantastic taste. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered seared scallops, a special. Totally amazing. \n",
      "\n",
      "We went with our servers recommendation on dessert, the flourless chocolate torte. I'm still pining over it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Above all, the service was phenomenal. We had a table of 8 and we always had an attentive server ready to answer any questions, provide recommendations that were always spot on, or even help us find a lost card. \n",
      "\n",
      "Great spot!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Didn't like the steak there . I ask for medium rare but it was wel done and cold . I am not going back there agian .\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This is a good steakhouse.  They use an Italian spice on their meat.  I'm generally not a fan of strong spices on meats but it was still good.  I had the strip and it was cooked perfectly.  Great service all around.  The sommelier was very polite and knowledgeable.  He recommend the perfect bottle of wine.  Reservations would be recommended.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Let this sink in for a second - THE GREATEST DINING EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.  I'm a foodie - and that really means a lot coming from me.  If you ever go to Vegas and want to take your wife, fiance, girlfriend, mother or mistress to an unbelievable experience - take them there.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was my Anniversary and my wife and I went to the Venetian for our big meal.  When we arrived, the hostess greeted us with a \"Happy Anniversary\" and sent us into the lounge for a drink on the house.  When our table was ready, they brought us into the dining room - where I see Tom Brady and Giselle Bunchen.  I nod to Tom, and he shoots me with his finger gun.  It was great!!  So we sit down, I am glowing - I learn that we have the best service ever coming our way. Our bus boy and two waiters were waiting for us with a free little sample appetizer for our Anniversary.  The dinner was splendid - it is an Emeril owned restaurant afterall.  We had a very memorable Banana Foster Bread Pudding with Cookies and Cream.  Best dessert ever.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I highly recommend Delmonico Steakhouse to anyone looking for a nice meal for a special occasion.  Great food, perfect service.  Five Stars!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] One of the best steak houses in Las Vegas. 3 of us ordered the bone in ribeye ($52 / order) and 1 of us ordered the filet (less than the bone in ribeye). I think the waiter said that the ribeye was a solid 19 ounce steak while the filet was 9 ounces so you can see the meat difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our server told us that they put a rub on the steak, the steak is carefully aged as well, and cook it with butter so it comes out with a nice char. Steaks were cooked perfectly and I like my steaks medium rare.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also paired it with a nice Sequoia Grove Cabernet Sauvignon 2006.\n",
      "\n",
      "The appetizers that we had were the truffle oil chips, creamed corn and sauteed mushrooms. The truffle and parmesan chips are a must to get...they're heavily!!! (couldn't taste the parmesan...even though I dislike cheese).\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a must try steak house if you're ever in Las Vegas for a great meal!!!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I go every time I'm in Vegas. Usually three times a year. This place is the best steak house anywhere, hands down. The bone in ribeye is perfected. BBQ shrimp app and banana cream pie to top it all off! Don't miss this gem!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] this place hasnt change a bit in their service and the great tasting steaks. every time im in vegas i be sure that is one stop i ALWAYS make...\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Everything on the menu is made with a little bit of heaven, a pinch of happiness, and two cups of love. Must try the lobster bisque !!! It's so amazing I considered asking the chef to have my children.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Pescatarian review:\n",
      "\n",
      "We came here because we had a hotel credit to use from the Palazzo so it was our fancy meal of the trip. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am a pescatarian so I had:\n",
      "-Chardonnay\n",
      "-Complimentary bread: lovely\n",
      "-Halibut with chantarelle mushrooms and black-rice risotto: the chanterelles were yummy. The halibut was well cooked and delicate. The black-rice risotto was different but overall, this dish was not real exciting.\n",
      "\n",
      "My family's dishes: \n",
      "-Chateaubriand: at $120 for 2 people, this was probably the best deal since it's the only one that came with sides of asparagus and mashed potatoes.\n",
      "-Filet Mignon\n",
      "-Rib Eye\n",
      "-Broccoli side\n",
      "-Baked potato\n",
      "\n",
      "They thought the rub was a little too salty and the rib eye meat to not be as high quality. The filet mignon and chateaubriand got a \"pretty good\" otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service here is very good. I'd say the decor is lacking. In a strip of restaurants in a 5 star hotel, it wasn't very grand and the entrance was easy to miss. It could have felt fancier.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, an ok first time at an Emeril restaurant.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The man has done it again!: On a recent trip to Vegas our casino host suggested we dine at the Delmonico for a nice steak in a fabulous environment. WOW! The atmosphere was cool & hip but not fake or stuffy as sometimes happens in upscale establishments. It was romantic & relaxed. We felt right at home. The service was top notch....friendly & efficient as one would hope. Our servers were always a nod away & ready to tend to all of our needs. The meal was simply fantastic. Our salads were crisp & fresh. We ordered the Chateaubriand for two & were blown away at the quality of beef & flavor. A nice touch was the final searing & butterfly filleting table side. Coffee was good. Dessert was shared as no room was left after the meal. We enjoyed every savory bite. The whole dinning experience has been one of our favorites to date.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Very proper waiting on you, we were one of the first to arrive. \n",
      "\n",
      "Food was excellent, most steak houses of this caliber are--if you're looking for a typical wine and dine situation this is the place. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ambiance was nice but nothing memorable.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Very good steak house.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Good service and food was well prepared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good location if you are going to a Venetian show.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only reason it did not get 5 stars is the price.  I have eaten at other steak houses in Vegas with equivilant or better steaks for less price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will go back if I am staying at the Venetian for sure.  Especially if someone else is paying.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Just one word people \" FABULOUS\" !!!!!! \n",
      "\n",
      "It was my first time eating in one of Emeril's restaurants and I'm so happy to say it definitely lived up to all the hype. The food Omg the food was mouth watering I ordered the bbq salmon which was to die for it had diced potatoes and chorizo (I think) The salmon was glazed with bbq sauce and was the best salmon I ever had it was finger liking good and my hubby ordered the bone in rib eye which he loved and for our side we order the grilled asparagus and twice baked potato. The food and service were superb. Next time I'm in Vegas I'm definitely going back !!!!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] A few of us went for my honeys bday recently this past weekend, we read reviews and figured we would try it. This place was ridiculous!! Omg!!! We had Fois gras and steak tar tar for apps (daalishsus), then there was a few perfectly cooked melt in your mouth ribeye steaks with daalishsus sides and an order of the butternut squash ravioli!! So buttery rich you didn't want it to end! and of course there was dessert, creme brulee and John brought the bday boy some perfect sorbet! ugh!!! Seriously where do they get off??  Then to top it off they had the nerve to provide amazing service as well! John, I assume the manager, was great very attentive, fun, well humored!! We will absolutely be returning especially since the birthday boy can't stop talking about it! Lol thank you Delmonico's staff for being awesome!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] In a city with overrated 'celebrity' steakhouses, Delmonico was a breath of fresh air. Impeccable service, delicious salads, and unbelievably delicious steak (we got the bone-in ribeye, creamed spinach, and garlic mushrooms). Definitely will be coming back the next time we're in town.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Excellent steakhouse. Well designed to be classy with some modern touches but not too modern you don't feel like you aren't in an old fashioned steakhouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "The filet mignon done au poive was superb (5/5). Not necessarily the most traditional prep but the cajun seasoning combined with the crusted pepper and very tender beef made for an awesome bite.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bone in rib eye (5/5) was also cooked expertly and one of the most flavorful and not too fatty pieces of steak I've had.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shrimp cocktail (3.5/5) was nice but I thought standard cocktail sauce would have been better. The slice of avocado and sprig of microgreens made it nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service was on point and very professional. \n",
      "\n",
      "Would come back here again. Thought it was better than Cut Steakhouse in the Venetian.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The prime rib was excellent and, to literally top it off, I ordered foie gras to complement the fantastic steak. Great ambience, great service, overall a great dining experience.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My boyfriend and I dined at Delmonico for Christmas. We arrived an hour before our scheduled reservation, as we were walking around the hotel, but did not want to wait till 9 o'clock, the time we had our reservation for.  Fortunately, we had no problem getting seated right away.\n",
      "\n",
      "We started off with the lobster bisque, which was creamy and full of flavor with large chunks of lobster meat.  For our entree, we each had the bone in rib eye (I had the lobster with my steak) with sautéed garlic mushrooms and country smashed potatoes.  Our steak was cooked to perfection (medium well; pink on the inside, brown on the outside).   Side portions are big enough to share with 2-3 people and even have some left over to take home.  We ended our evening with the duck egg crème brûlée.  My only complaint about the dessert is it was served completely cold.   I've had crème brûlée in many restaurants, and I typically have had it served at room temperature, as the sugar is torched right before it is served.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot express enough what great customer service wait staff provides at Delmonico!  Staff was incredibly attentive.  They have three servers waiting on you.   They constantly check on you and top your drinks off.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Like most fab steakhouses, Delmonico is pricey.  With tip, our tab was $300, but it was absolutely worth every penny.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Like I previously mentioned, our dinner was delicious, but what made our experience even more amazing was the staff.  I have NEVER experienced such great customer service.  \n",
      "\n",
      "When in Vegas and you're craving steak, Delmonico is a MUST!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Wow, all I can is wow.  I've been here many times in the past several years, but I have to say, this last time was my most favorite, most memorable and most enjoyable.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I sat at the bar and met Max Solano; to say he was a bartender is an understatement.  I've never called anyone a \"mixologist\" before, but if ever there was a man who deserved that title, its Max.  You can tell that his craft goes into every drink.  I sat at the bar, sipping what could have very well been the BEST Old Fashioned I've ever had and I watched him work.  He has the same passion behind the bar as a painter with a canvas, except his paint is liquor and his canvas, a glass.  With his jigger as a brush, he creates a drinkable Jackson Pollock\n",
      "\n",
      "My steak was perfectly prepared and my time at the bar was most enjoyable.  It was a perfect finish to a long work week in Vegas.  I can't wait to go back.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Service was fabulous. Wine was great. This steakhouse is not your typical steakhouse. Great twist on flavors. Super unique while still holding the quality at a high level. Personally, many of the dishes had too many fried components for me and was a tad overwhelming but other than my personal preference on that... 5 stars all around. Classic steakhouse with a twist. I would highly recommend.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Apparently finding a high-end restaurant on the Strip that serves lunch is more difficult than I thought. With many spots only open for dinner service I opted to dine at one of the few with a lunch menu -- Delmonico.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We started with the wild arugula salad -- shaved apple, candied walnuts tossed in champagne vinaigrette with a trio of artisan cheeses. It was a large portion that they split for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife had a steak panini served medium rare on ciabatta. The accompanying horseradish was overpowering, but the beef was still excellent. The sandwich came with some amazingly crispy and light truffle fries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lobster sliders I ordered was a small order of two. The Maine lobster was lightly dressed with a citrus aioli and celery leaves, helping make this some of the tastiest lobster you'll find in any sandwich in town. The Old Bay fries that they came with were tasty, but not nearly as good as the truffle fries. My only complaint about this dish is the size. Something this delicious shouldn't be constrained to two sliders per order.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.5 Stars\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My companion thought his rib-eye was very good, but nothing to differentiate it from other quality steakhouses. I had the salmon dish that the waiter said was a signature dish on most of Emeri's restaurant menus. My salmon was topped with bbq sauce and had a sausage hash - the salmon was prepared well, but I didn't care for the taste of the dish. Instead of bread, they came by at the beginning of the meal with two oily popovers per person.  The room is unattractive.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This is the second Emerill Lagasse restaurant I've been to and it was just as amazing as the first one (the fish house at MGM).  Two completely different types of cuisines but both restaurants had amazing food and outstanding service.  My friends ordered the bone in rib eye and the rib eye and thought it was one of the best steaks they've had.  I ordered the pork loin which came with two pieces of pork belly as well and it was cooked to perfection...very tender and moist.  And I must emphasize that service was top notch at all levels...starting from the host to the bartenders to our server to the staff!  A must try when you're in Sin City!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Last year for my 21st birthday we went to Vegas and after hearing my boyfriend rave about this restraunt for two years, I knew I had to take him here! \n",
      "Oh he was so very right, it was AMAZING; definitely a well $200.00 spent! I would HIGHLY reccomend this restaurant.\n",
      "PS: You have to try the calamari!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I took a group of eight to Delmonico for business. My party included a number of foodies, including a couple that prided themselves on having been to the best steakhouses around. Most people had steak and Delmonico fared extremely well, with one person saying it was one of the two best steakhouses he had ever been to. We enjoyed the appetizers -- Emeril sure knows his barbequed shrimp! Sides were excellent, including asparagus, creamed corn, and au gratin potatoes. I had the salmon, which was extremely flavorful and perfectly prepared (despite being farm raised). The wine list is extensive and impressive, although finding a reasonably priced bottle was a challenge. Service was truly exceptional.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had appetizers to share for the whole table, top-end entrees, and two desserts.  Also quite a few bottles of wine (albeit on the lower end of the price list) and several after dinner drinks.  With tax and tip the meal was a bit over $150/person.  Clearly not a budget place, but for a top Las Vegas restaurant and for the amount we ordered I thought this very reasonable.  You could easily blow the budget on that wine list though!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I would recommend this to anyone that's in Vegas and wants a good steak. The bone in ribeye was certainly amazing, along with appetizers. And I think the price is very reasonable. \n",
      "\n",
      "If I have to complain about anything is that I didn't like the Caesar salad cuz it was drenched in dressing. But everything else was super yummy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here is what we ordered:\n",
      "Tuna and salmon tartar: omg so good. Combined with the crispy chips, I could order two of it for an entry next time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fresh oysters: tasted very fresh\n",
      "\n",
      "BBQ Shrimp: got it despite yelp reviews say not to. Thought it was pretty good. Nice bbq sauce. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lobster bisque: good but too salty. Tasted better with bread. There were big chunks of lobsters though. \n",
      "\n",
      "Caesar salad: it was made table side. Nothing spectacular, and way too much dressing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bone in rib eye: Amazing\n",
      "\n",
      "New York Strip: pretty good but wasn't as good as the rib eye. \n",
      "\n",
      "Salmon: forgot the exact name but it was very good. It had like gumbo style things on the bottom which made it interesting. \n",
      "\n",
      "Garlic mushroom side: good \n",
      "\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Delmonico's does not disappoint. Its a classic, upscale steakhouse with absolutely fantastic food. I go to Vegas every Memorial Day weekend and every year I pick a different Vegas steakhouse for one of my dinners. Last year was Cut and I was EXTREMELY disappointed. Delmonico however was fabulous. I had the lettuce wedge salad and the filet oscar and both were absolutely delicious. My husband had the spinach frisee salad and the filet au poivre and he also really enjoyed them. The food, atmosphere, everything was just fabulous! The only thing to be aware of is that its VERY expensive-- the filet oscar was $70! But its Vegas and its Emeril and its a fantasic restaurant so its well worth it for a night out.  I will definitely be back.\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Emril Lagasi's snazzy steak house at the Venetian.  The big brown leather chairs have stuck in my mind.  Filet was cooked to perfection.  Service was very attentive.  We left happy.  Will probably head back after experiencing some more of what Vegas has to offer.  So much to see... so little time!\n",
      "\n",
      "I would give it 4.5 stars if I could, but I am going to have to agree about the ambiance - a bit on the bright side (sights n'sound).  In the end, Delmonico's seemed to be a consistent and classic dining experience.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The bone-in ribeye was prepared to perfection.  Asparagus Spears and garlic smash made it a perfect meal.  The only knock was the service time.  The place wasn't packed so expected the staff to respond faster.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This place was the bomb-digity!  One of the best meals I've ever had.  I know they are known for the bone-in ribeye but go with the filet oscar style.   My crew and I were out for my bachelor party and we had a 10:30PM dinner and we ended up staying there till about 1 in the morning.  The wait staff was awesome, not pushy at all and very helpful.  Even joked with us a little bit.  We were definitely the last ones in the place but they were happy to let us stay as long as we wanted.  Highly recommend this place, very classy.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Didn't eat.  Sat at bar and had wine.  Pretty reasonably priced considering it's vegas.  Wine by glass list well above average.  Very competent bartender.  Would return.\n",

      "We were seated near the entrance to the dining room, but were hoping for a table deep into the interior.\n",
      "Asthe evening proceeded, we found that we could have a very fine conversation, while those dining well into the room had to raise the level of their conversation just to be heard over the din coming from  the remainder of the room.  \n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Minimalist decor, maximalist flavor!  the dry-aged ribeye steak was a marvel of cut and cure, and flawlessly prepared with a lump of butter oozing over the edges (as if the marbled steak didn't have enough cholesterol to make me reach for a double hit of pravastatin!) I generally order beef cooked medium-well which tends to dry out the meat; however the chefs here knew what they were doing and delivered the most fork tender medium well i have ever eaten!  The maitre'd oversaw the dining sequence and operation with panache, though the grim-faced waiters could have used a few lessons on how to develop an engaging personality.  The prices were reasonable for Vegas top flight restaurants.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] OMG, was the first thing I said when I bit into the juicy, delicious, tender bone in ribeye. Yes very pricey but HUGE serving. All the sides were delicious as well; au gratin, broccoli, medley of mushrooms, popovers, asparagus. Really delicious. My friend had the lamb chops. This meal was so fulfilling, definitely bigger portions than expected so  next time sharing may be perfect. But absolutely delicious and great service and I just have to say, our buss boy was hot!\n",

They aren't overly friendly, the barely look at you and they speed you to your table, but that's where I wanted to be anyway. Service in every other way was impeccable. I was pretty impressed with the waitstaff from the start. They were amazing.\n",

      "Sat down and only had water between me and the business associate I was with. He declined an appetizer, but I chose to have the half dozen oysters on the half shell. They were tiny, but delicious. I definitely would recommend these if you enjoy nice, mildly salty and briny oysters. They had a lot of flavor for the size.\n",

      "\n",
      "My steak was a nice size and it was cooked medium rare with the outside being a little tough and very seared on the outside making it tasted burned almost. I ate around that and was pleased. It isn't the best steak I've ever had, but the prices were reasonable so it hurt less. \n",
      "\n",
      "The foie gras was tasteless and a waste of money. I like mine to be buttery and melt in my mouth. Not happening here, save your money. There are a lot better places to get it.\n",

      "My associate had the filet and I tasted it; it was tender and moist. It was cooked perfectly, but the outside was pepper coated and it tasted bitter. Not a fan of that.\n",
      "\n",
      "For dessert we split the banana cream pie and it was the best part of the whole night. Highly recommend! It tasted like something my mom would make and I loved it! It was big and we couldn't finish it. I bet it would have tasted awesome right out of the fridge the next day, but alas I left it there. \n",

The best thing was the dessert of pecan pie. I'm just going to go there for that!\n",

Cannot say one bad thing about this place . Emeril has it down to a fine art! You will not be disappointed!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] WOW. This place did not disappoint. I had a pretty high expectation, especially after seeing 5 reviews (yeah out of 600+ lol) that said the steak might be better than Mastro's my most favorite steakhouse. \n",
      "\n",
      "Being a true tubby at heart, I was the only one who ordered 2 appetizers lol. I had the BBQ shrimp (it's aight), wilted spinach & frisée (super delicious), and I tried the ravioli too (my friends loved it but it's aight for me maybe because I wasn't feeling like pasta). \n",
      "\n",
      "I had the Chateaubriand for my main and I lovvvveee the Creole seasoning on it. It was served with a huge handful of asparagus that looked really fresh and mash, which tasted delicious with the creole juice/sauce. My medium-rare steak was cooked perfectly and was super delish. Mastro's steak still wins though!\n",
      "\n",
      "We also had a side of grits (good) and creamed corn (yummy). And for dessert, as usual we had a buffet of it. The best ones (in order): Bourbon bread pudding, pecan pie, espresso Creme brûlée.

      "We shall return!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I'll start out by saying the service and environment were both great.  Delmonico seems to draw a good balance between those hyper-formal restaurants where utensil etiquette matters and more casual fine dining restaurants. \n",
      "\n",
      "I tried the foie gras and octopus appetizers.  The octopus was delicious and had a decent amount of meat.  The foie gras was rich.  I followed these with the gumbo which had a mild spiciness that anyone should be able to enjoy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The disappointment occurred during the main course.  Three of the people in our party ordered the filet mignon.  Two of us were immediately dissatisfied with the plate.  I had ordered medium-rare and my dissatisfied friend had ordered theirs rare. My filet was noticeably dry and neither were especially tender. I suspect mine may have been overcooked because the third filet was also a medium-rare and the butter on top of their steak was still present, whereas mine had altogether melted by the time the plate reached our table.    Additionally, whatever seasoning was used for my filet was not spread evenly.  There was only one bite where the seasoning became obvious and it overwhelmed the flavor of the meat.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a steak that costs over $50 at an establishment that is a steakhouse, I hold it to certain standards, like being appreciated by a majority of the people at my party who ordered it. I can understand one person not enjoying their steak at a table because they have specific preferences, but for two people at the same table to be dissatisfied makes me believe the quality of the cooking is unreliable.  I have definitely cooked better steaks than the ones I tried  during this meal, and unfortunately this is the first steakhouse I have been to where that has been the case.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Everything from the starters to the dessert was amazing. Highly recommended. Only loss of a star was for the restaurant decor. Very boring.\n",

The food is great but I expect something more spectacular at Emeril's restaurant.  Maybe I need to try a steak here next time.  It is a great lunch stop when you are looking for a place with no wait.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This place is excellent.  I would highly recommend it for steak.  I ordered the NY.  I ordered medium rare, but it came out overcooked to a medium well.... I would have complained and asked for another one, had the steak not been so effin' delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "even though it was over cooked, by my taste, it still ranked on my top steaks that i've eaten.  that's got to say something.  But I will say that in my groups of 10 friends, the majority of them got their steaks exactly how they ordered it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sides are good.  The fresh buns they serve are fantastic.  and they do supply some sauces with the steaks, but man... you just don't want to spoil the taste of these awesome steaks.\n",

I had the 8oz fillet and it was just perfection! The flavor, how it was grilled a perfect medium! You have to try your steak with their red wine reduction! The wife wanted salmon with lobster sauce which they don't offer. Did they say sorry we don't have lobster sauce? NO! They said we will be happy to make you a creamy lobster sauce and she said it was the best she had ever eaten. Now coming from my wife, that's saying something! She is the pickiest eater in the world! And salmon is a tricky fish to grill because it dries out fast and it was juicy and moist as hell! (I had to try a bite) and they used huge chunks of main lobster in the sauce! AT NO EXTRA CHARGE!!!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "The garlic mash (or as they call it, smashed) potato was good and the BBQ shrimp app was really good also. Bottom line, you would be a fool not to try this place out. It was well worth the $145 we spent there!!!!!\n",

      "So I just stopped by to have lunch by myself. I read the reviews and cannot wait to have a perfectly cooked Filet Mignon. I got the BBQ shrimp and the Filet Mignon ordered specifically MEDIUM RARE. The BBQ shrimps are four tiny shrimps that are by no means jumbo shrimps but suspiciously resembled frozen out of a bag. \n",
      "\n",
      "And then is the Filet Mignon. They overcooked it so much that when I taste it, I almost wanted to cry. It can hardly pass for well done. I was so hungry and I waited 35 minutes for it. But I had to wash it down my throat with water. If this is MEDIUM RARE, then I will be ordering a live cow next time. The manager Michael did come by, confirmed that the steak is overcooked and asked if they can take it back. (I cannot wait for another 30 minutes for a new one. Doesn't a customer's time mean anything to you?) This is nice. But when the chef finished cooking my steak, how can he decide this is OK to serve? He must have cared so little about how his customer would think to decide to serve me this. LET ME TELL YOU. IT IS NO DIFFERENT THAN SPITTING IN MY FACE.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paid 95 dollars for the bill. I am feeling like a complete loser right now. Good thing is at least I came alone. If I have brought my GF, she would think I want a break up.

      "\n",
      "We ordered the bone-in rib-eye and the filet mignon. Although the bone-in rib-eye is the most popular steak at the restaurant, my personal favorite is the filet mignon just for its AMAZING tenderness. I'm really bad at describing taste with words, so all I will say is this: perfection. And you HAVE to pair the steaks with the house red wine. It transformed our meal even more.\n",
      "\n",
      "And for dessert, we got the banana cream pie.. and I wanted to cry. That honestly the best way for me to describe my experience. I took one bite, and wanted to cry. \"It was the best tasting dessert I had ever had in my life\" is an understatement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I loved the look of the restaurant. It wasn't as dimly lit was I thought it would be, which I actually was pleasantly surprised about because I'm tired of not being able to see my food. The design is very minimalist but still very sophisticated.. but not TOO sophisticated that regular folks like my boyfriend and I didn't feel out of place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although it was incredibly expensive, the food and the overall experience was so incredible that even my boyfriend, who can be pretty frugal sometimes, said that Delmonico's HAS to be a place we go back to EVERY year. I can't wait for the next time. :)\n",

      "Some friends and I had lunch at Delmonico's this past weekend and we got there right when it opened for lunch. We were their first customers and spent most of our lunch being the only people in the restaurant. Therefore, I guess it's no surprise why we got such great service. We made small talk with our servers and they were very pleasant and attentive throughout our entire meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "One friend who has been here before was raving about their lobster bisque and banana creme pie. I got to try their lobster bisque ($16) and thought it was good but I'm no connoisseur of bisque.  The bisque comes with scrumptious pieces of lobster and it was very rich and creamy. I ordered the Filet of Beef Medallions ($21) and they were super tender. Although they were covered in bread crumbs and a mushroom type sauce, the medallions were quite delicious. The entree isn't very big and I was still hungry afterwards so I suggest getting this alongside an appetizer. I got a bite of the Banana Creme Pie and not only did it look amazing, the taste of it was delightful. \n",
      "\n",
      "Delmonico's is a surprisingly huge restaurant. I hope their dinner draws in a larger crowd that it does for lunch or else much of their space could be put to better use. The lunch menu is rather limited but it's priced right with the most expensive entree being only $21. All in all, pretty good food and extremely good service. You gotta try that Banana Creme Pie!\n",

The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the mashed potatoes.  It had a pasty texture to it.  I prefer my mashed potatoes fluffy.  We topped off the night with a slice of the banana cream pie.

Ordered both the foie gras and the truffle Parmesan potato chips to start. They were both brought to the table at the same time so I knew I would need to eat the foie gras first which was quite good. The potato chips were great, and since I had ordered the wagyu ribeye for $90, I didn't want to fill up on the chips, I asked if they could box up the chips to take back to my room.  No problem, and they were delicious the next day! The wagyu ribeye is the best beef I've ever had! Perfect med-rare with great flavor and the most tender beef ever! I've had wagyu at other steakhouses in LV, but this blew away the competition!  The size was perfect for me: 6 or 8 ounces (I forgot which). Since this is white truffle season, I chose the white truffle ice cream that is vanilla ice cream stuffed with lots of small pieces of truffle. It is served as 3 balls which I figured I'd eat one or two, but it was so addictive that I ate the whole thing! Service was very friendly and attentive. Delmonico Steakhouse is now my favorite steakhouse!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The steak was cooked perfectly and was worth the price. In addition, we ordered the truffle potato chips and devoured them in minutes. I also got a lychee drink which was pretty good but probably too expensive for me to ever order again. But if we're ever back in Vegas, we'll be sure to drop by this restaurant again for the steak!\n",

Waiters are clueless, they are just standing in the middle but most of the time really doing nothing that in few ocassions I have to pour my own wine in my glass. The head waiter is the only one who seems to be working and who do know what to do here.\n",
      "            We are given a small apetizer courtesy of the chef bec of my husbands b-day which is a good touch, I love this little appetizer (not in the menu, wish it was there because that would be the only highlight of the evening) a concoction of smoke chicken with couscous with a little spices, the taste is all balance and in harmony.\n",
      "           The fried green tomatoes appetizer is bland, whatever coating and sauce they put in there didnt help at all.  The spinach and raddichio salad is soaked on its own dressing which you cannot even tell which dressing it is, salads when presented are supposed to be crisp, so make sure you only put the dressing when it is ready to be eaten, very disappointing since the head weater gladly recommended this dish.\n",
      "          My husband ordered Bone in Ribeye Steak, huge, cooked perfect but no taste or seasoning at all, it would need some sort of sauce to make it appetizing.  Filet mignon is OK, just like any other filet mignon, nothing great about it.\n",
      "         Luckily there's one dish that is worth mentioning, the potato gratin dauphineous, excellent, potato perfectly cooked, not much cream, hint of garlic and toasty top, excellent!\n",
      "        Going back? No way, very expensive and I'm not happy.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The lobster bisque was wonderful!! Ahi tuna was a tad fishy.. But still edible. Service was nice. I didn't really appreciate the seating... Since we sat next to a cleaning station. Not impressed. Wanted something equivalent to mastros but it wasn't even remotely close. It just looks nice but tasted... Mediocre. The ribeye would of been better if I made it myself. They were seriously off their game.. Was hoping to be \"wowed\" but I definitely had better.. This isn't a must have. Only eat here for convenience if you are staying at the hotel.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Delmonico is a favorite. Time after time it delivers stellar food and superb service.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Caesar salad for two is a must, as is the bone in ribeye. We've also enjoyed daily specials that have served up surf and turf, and some of the tastiest lamb chops we've ever tasted. We've sampled a bunch of other dishes, as well. The only disappointment has been at dessert and that was banana cream pie. It was served partially frozen. Ever since we tend to skip dessert and treat ourselves to Jamaican Blue Mountain French pressed coffee, instead. It is wonderful.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] It's been a long time since I been to Delmonico's. I used to be a big fan of Emeril. I'm sure I had some pork dish and something wrap i bacon. Just make sure you make reservation WAY in advance.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Atmosphere is very conservative.  Service was great, however steaks are okay not OUTSTANDING like at Prime at Bellagio.  The sides were excellent.  The wine menu is over 100 pages.  But really not work the $52 for a bone in ribeye\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This has to be the best steakhouse i have ever been to in my life. I would recommend anybody who is dining at the strip to try this once. This is a great steakhouse, reservations are a must as we went at 5pm on a Thursday and they were pretty much full and they open at 5. \n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant is right next to the theaters in between the Venetian and palazzo. The place is huge and the service is excellent.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered the chateaubriand steak for two which was 18oz and they carved the steak and cooked it to perfection right on tableside. We also got the mashed potatoes along with creamy spinach for the sides but just the steak alone was so tasty you don't really bother with the sides even though we did. \n",
      "\n",
      "The server was super professional and from start to finish they crushed it and made sure we enjoyed the dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "5 stars all the way. This is the restaurant which deserves more as lots of places get the 5 star rating. Delmonico should open up a place in South Florida so i don't have to go to Vegas just to enjoy a steak, just a suggestion.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] BY FAR my favorite steakhouse in the country.  The steak is seasoned perfectly, no sauce required.  All sides we ordered were great and I think we ordered every side on the menu, you must get truffle and parmesan chips!  The service is incredible, a completely orchestrated dinner service is always impressive when your at a table of 9 and each plate hits the table at the same time.  Servers/staff are watching every movement and are very good at anticipating needs and requests.  The dining room has a modern minimalist look but very nice, you dont hear this much but the tables and chairs were really nice.  When in Vegas make sure you go to Delmonico.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This restaurant is world class. It is one of the top steakhouses that I have been too. I would rate it in better than a ruth chris, ditka's, chop house and in the same category as a shula's or capitol grill.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service is 5* as they have 3+ waiters taking care of you constantly, but not overbearing. Type of place where you leave to use the washroom and you  come back to the table and with a folded napkin and a refilled water glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Love the appetizers, my wife believes it they have the best lobster bisque soup out there.\n",
      "\n",
      "The steak's are great sizes and range from $42-$50, but you're truly getting what you pay for. For the dolts who dinged this place because of the cost, if you want a piece of grizzle for $20 then go to outback.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever my wife and I come to vegas and we need to celebrate something, this is the restaurant we do it at.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Our group of 14 was staying at the Venetian and Delmonicos was our pick for a nice fancy dinner. Since we had a night full of drinking ahead of us, we definitely didn't want to over-stuff our stomachs so each couple agreed to share a steak along with lots of appetizers and sides. \n",
      "\n",
      "To start off, some of us had the salmon and tuna tartare, wedged salad, baked oysters, french escargot, shrimp cocktail, and lobster bisque. They were all quite tasty! \n",
      "\n",
      "The BF and I shared a Bone-in Ribeye. Asked for medium rare but it came out medium well. I was disappointed since I really hate eating well done meat. Luckily the flavoring itself was pretty delicious or I'd definitely have to have it recooked. I also had an addition of seared Foie Gras as well - which was the absolute BEST part of my meal. The flavoring and texture was perfect and after my last bite, I found myself wanting more still!\n",
      "\n",
      "Along with our main entree, we had an order of almost every side they had listed on their dinner menu: buttered asparagus, buttered broccoli, creamed spinach, sauteed garlic mushrooms, mash potatoes, creamed corn gratinee, and potato gratin. All the sides are meant to be shared family style and a scoop of each was more than plentiful to compliment your main course. I loved the creamed corn the most. \n",
      "\n",
      "As full I already was, I saw expresso creme brulee on their dessert menu so of course I couldn't pass up on that. Glad I didn't either bc it was fantastic!\n",
      "\n",
      "Service was excellent and our three waiters were extremely attentive and helpful throughout our entire meal. Overall, we had a pleasant dining experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "3.5 stars because my steak came out medium well instead of medium rare, but because the service was superb, 4 stars it is! Next time, get my steak right please =)\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Great food. Great service too if you're a high roller, no so much for the average diner like me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The table next to ours had someone on staff stopping by to check on the every few minutes, chat them up, pour more wine, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our table of six received very mechanical service. Food was dropped off, and no one bothered to ask how the food was or of any of us would like another drink (two of us sat with an empty glass from the middle of the meal onward).\n",
      "\n",
      "Fine dining is about the overall experience, and Delmonico let me down with poor service.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was my second visit. I tried to give then a second chance, but this visit only confirmed the poor service from my first.  I will not be going back.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Best Steak I ever eaten - Delmonico Rib Eye. It's pricey but worth it. You will not be disappointed.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We arrived 20 mins late to our reservation and were so thankful they were accommodating. The bone-in ribeye, beef tartar, and every other appetizer we ordered was delicious. The meat didn't have too much fat which was the best part. Other steakhouses will serve your steak with bigger chunks of fat, so I felt like I was getting my money's worth here. The service was okay. Dress code tip: It's a nice restaurant but not extremely fancy.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I was in Las Vegas for work, so was dining alone. I had no reservation but was able to eat at the bar. I had the rib-eye steak medium rare with a side of asparagus. The rib-eye  was amazing. It had a beautiful char and was delicious. Service was excellent and attentive. \n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely one of the best dining options in Vegas.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Good steak, good wine, good grits, no complaints...minus the bill\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Had dinner here last week and I have one advice - Do NOT get the Prix Fix!!  We had the seafood tower, which was great except for the tuna tartare on the top - the tuna did not taste fresh at all.  Some of us got the summer prix fix option, which sounded like a great deal for $65.  All the appetizers were good, especially the tomato soup/grilled cheese.  Then the entrees came.  I had the petite ribeye, and it was seriously the worst steak I ever had.  It tasted like cheap top sirloin from Sizzler, really tough & chewy.  Emeril would be ashamed if he tasted it.  My daughter ordered off the regular menu and had the bone-in ribeye, which was delicious.  Maybe it was my fault for ordering the prix fix... I understand it's cheaper... but the quality was so poor and definitely no way near $65.  I'm giving them 2 stars for good appetizers but will be staying away from the prix fix menu.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Had a great dinner here with some close friends. I had the filet, ahi tartare, and sauteed spinach. Everything was very good and the steak was done just right. The only things that I thought were subpar were the bread rolls and the decor. \n",
      "\n",
      "I really enjoyed Delmonico.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] f you are going to eat here the only suggestion as mentioned before is to go with the Porterhouse. You will not regret it! At $85 the price is a bit of a turn off and there are other nice cuts available around a $50 range. Although, at 32 oz and being one of the best steaks I ever had in my life it was well worth it. Service was also fairly good although not superb. Very professional staff but during the busy dinner hours are not the most attentive.\n",
      "\n",
      "I made my reservations well in advance on the Venetian website and did not have to wait a minute to be seated.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I have been coming to this place for the last five years and it never disappoints.  One of my Vegas go to dining spots.  Visited last Thursday again.  A few favorites:\n",
      "\n",
      "Arrive early and visit Max the Bartender.  Just recently learned he is a world class mixologist (after ordering wine for years) and will create beverages that will make your head spin.  Has his own bitters collection to add a custom touch.  Tequila Gumption he made me was world class.\n",
      "\n",
      "I always get the Filet Pittsburgh Style and it is exceptional.  Not too loaded down with butter and just the right flavor.  If I am steaked out, The Salmon dish is incredible.  Creamed Corn is to die for with jalapeno seasoning topping (I am hyper critical of creamed corn but thing D's and STK are two of the best).  Biscuits that they serve are out of this world.  Potato chips with truffle oil are a nice indulgence.  Caprese salad is a great starter.  Like the wine list and not over priced like Del Frisco and the Wynn or Bellagio spots.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finish it off with a double espresso and you are ready to venture on into the evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "I prefer to sit in the main room and the seating towards the back is preferred.  Lamont is the best server by far.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] if you're looking for a fancy steakhouse in vegas, delmonico is your go to place. not being a huge fan of emeril lagasse's, my prenotions and opinions were turned 180 degrees after one dining experience in this magnificent establishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "nothing here is shy of a stellar review. the food is PERFECTLY executed, the service is above and beyond, and no detail is left unfinished.\n",
      "\n",
      "the steaks can be requested with an extra char on the outside, but the center is still a warm medium rare, perfectly juicy and exploding with flavor in every bite. the sides we ordered were also high acheivers and could be main courses in their own right. \n",
      "\n",
      "the desserts were phenomenal! i've had emeril's banana cream pie from another one of his restaurants at MGM before, but the warm chocolate brioche bread pudding is like your birthday, christmas, new year, all the holidays, the birth of your first child, happiest day of your life in every spoonful. it was so good, i wanted to cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "if you are ever in vegas and want to have a flawless steak dinner, now you know where to go.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I came here for my Bros Bachelor party and we had a party of 5. I made a reservation on opentable.com while i was at work and it was very convenient! We walked over here on saturday night around 6 to start the night off right with a good steak dinner. This place came highly recommended from a friend. \n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant was overly amazing. It was clean and dimly light like most steak places. The waiters were knowledgeable and prompt with their service. I got kind of a pretentious vibe from our waiter which was a little off putting. But it didnt bother me too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the Filet Mignon medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. I was very impressed. The steak was soft and flavorful and melted in my mouth. The side dishes were just ok. We ordered broccoli, creamed spinach, and fingerling potatoes. I wasnt impressed by the sides all that much. Not extremely flavorful but still decent.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also ordered a $200 bottle of wine which was the most expensive wine i have drank before. I didnt know much about it, the winery was called Mastery and it was a red wine. My bro ordered it not me and it was really good! It was listed on the last page of the wine menu and was $40 a glass, but we ordered a bottle for the table. i wish i figured out what wine it was but it was really really good.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a good spot for a vegas dinner and a great way to start the night! i would definitely check out some other places before i come back here but i recommend it!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Best steakhouse in Vegas! Be sure to ask for Lamont as your waiter for an extra special experience. We had the ribeye, filet, and New York . All amazing!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We have eaten here multiple times over the years.  We have enjoyed the chef's table on 3 different occasions, including a family dinner the night before my sister-in-law got married.  \n",

      "A couple of things not to miss:\n",
      "        Appetizers: N.O. barbecue shrimp,  truffle, parmesan potato chips\n",
      "        Entrees:  American Buffalo ribeye, the bone-in ribeye, lamb chops\n",
      "        Dessert:  brioche bread pudding, Delmonico chocolate cake\n",
      "\n",
      "Wine List:  I swear the darn book weighs 10 pounds.  They have an extensive wine list and it can be intimidating.  I have found the sommelier  has always been approachable (some restaurants have sommeliers that are kind of snotty or stand offish) and helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adult Beverages:  I like champagne and wine but they have some really nice cocktails and I would suggest trying one or two.  \n",
      "     The Lady Lychee\n",
      "     A Tale of Two Cherries\n",
      "     La Flor Mayor - for a little kick  \n",
      "\n",
      "They also have an impressive list of whiskey & whisky.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several seating areas of the restaurant, so you can have an intimate meal, a family get together or enjoy a group of friends.  I enjoy sitting on the long bench because it is comfy and I can people watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have a special event, reserve the Chef's Table but show up hungry because they are going to FEED YOU!  No tasting size dishes and they will toss in a surprise or two.  Like the time we had a wonderful ribeye main course, and thinking we were getting dessert, in walks another main course!  A spectacular lamb chop that was the best I have ever eaten.  \n",
      "\n",
      "And if you are just looking for some munchies and a drink - visit the bar.  Michelle is a great bartender and the food is the best bar food you will find.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or need your Emeril dessert fix - pop into the bar and have a dessert with a vintage cocktail.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Delmonico's is always a solid choice for quality meal. The service has always been attentive & professional and the food is always top notch. The wine list is also quite impressive with a wide variety.\n",
      "\n",
      "Steaks are their specialty and are always a safe bet, but they do have other items. Last time we went I had the sea bass, which was quite tasty.  As always, try to leave room for the banana cream pie!\n",
      "\n",
      "The other places have a certain vibe to it that feels like it would be an Emeril Lagasse restaurant, for some reason this one doesn't. Don't get me wrong, it's a great place, it just didn't 'feel' like an Emeril's.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Food was excellent!!!!  The favorites of our group were lobster, ribeye, filet, rack of lamb.  Salmon was a bit dry and halibut was just ok, but fine.  My personal standout for the many sides we got was the potatoes au gratin...I'm still dreaming!!!  Our service was just ok until the end when our server scolded someone in our group and said \"sssshhhhh.\"   Really???  If he was ruining something for other customers (which I'm sure he wasn't--others tables were toasting with us) than a manager should've come up and said something, not her.  I mentioned to the hostess we were a lively group and to sit us accordingly.  She assured me it was not a problem.  We spent a lot of money and ended on a sour note--which is no bueno....it could've been handled so much better.  Also, they knew we were celebrating an anniversary and didn't bring a complimentary dessert??? (I think even Cheesecake Factory does that?).  It just seemed the waitress had a personality problem and didn't like us from the get go. Unfortunately, this is the second visit here where the service has fallen short.  Four stars for food.  Not in a hurry to go back.  There's no \"sssshhhhh-ing in Vegas!\"\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Let me start off by saying that I am a huge foodie LOVE all of Emerils restaurants. I started off by ordering the wilted spinach salad with bacon vinaigrette that was absolutely to die for that I ended up licking the plate. They also did a very cool soft-boiled egg that was then fried and one of the first I'd ever seen and pull it off perfect.  My main dish was perfectly cooked and super tasty ( the barbecued salmon dish).  It was served on top of a bacon potato hash and I ordered the cream corn as a side dish.  Yum yum yum!!!  I wanted to put that potato hash in my pocket and take it home!. I would highly recommend this for anyone coming in and if my review were only based on this then I would give it a five star!  Unfortunately it's not...The other four people in our party decided to order steaks and all of them disliked them...I am from Texas so I never make the mistake of ordering a steak outside of Texas because I am almost always let down.  Our server was mean and did not do her job well. She seemed that it was almost more of an annoyance when we wanted to order anything!  I hate to say it but come on, You're in Vegas as a high end server....The wait time in between drink orders seemed extremely longer than normal and when the manager finally came over to address the steaks, he did nothing....Even though my food was perfect the whole experience was just off-putting and The Decour of the restaurant needs a major overhaul. Bland and boring....I also found it very unprofessional that they had about 15 chairs stacked in the hallway between the restaurant on your way to the bathroom....anyway I hate giving this restaurant only two stars but I want everybody to know...\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] A trip to Las Vegas just isn't a trip to Vegas without a stop at Delmonico.

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I am a sucker for celebrity chef restaurants. After a poor dining experience at Gordon Ramsey's Pub & Grill, I was a little skeptical to try another one. Delmonico was wonderful and would blow the pants off anything with Gordon Ramsey's name attached.\n",

      "\n",
      "I ordered the vine-ripened tomato salad with burrata, which was very tasty. For my meal, I had the filet mignon, cooked PERFECTLY medium rare. Overcooked meat does not make me happy, so I was very pleased with how mine came out. I also ordered a baked potato with the works...this potato was HUGE. The waitress even offered to being me more toppings if I ran out.\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We came here for my husbands birthday dinner.  We were a few minutes early so had drinks in the lounge, A Tale Of Two Cherries and Louisiana Hard Tea.  Drinks were good and packed a punch.  We started with Barbecue Shrimp and Fried Green Tomatoes.  Barbecue shrimp was the same as at Emeril's other restaurants.  Delicious.  I only wish you got more then 4 shrimp and 1 tiny biscuit.  The fried green tomatoes were one of the nights specials.  They were topped with lump crap and fried light and crisp.  For our Entrees I got Emeril's Barbecue Salmon, he got Bone In Ribeye.  We chose Twiced Baked Potato and Grits for our sides.  Salmon and steak were both wonderful and cooked perfectly.  The sides were creamy and rich, but very similar in flavor.  We loved them both but probably should have order something with more variety.  We finished with Banana Cream Pie and Caramel Butter Cake for dessert.  The Banana Cream Pie is Emeril's signature dessert that is served in all his restaurants.  Hubby loves it and it's a must order for us.  It was our first time ordering the Caramel Butter Cake and it didn't disappoint.  It was served warm and covered in gooey caramel.  Service started off slow, but got better as the meal went on.  We had incorrect charges on our bill that were quickly corrected when we brought it to our servers attention.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Great Experience. We had a couple of friends in town and this place came highly Recommended. The cherry martini is so good! I could eat a bowl of the liquor soaked cherries they put in it! We had the bbq shrimp, lobster bisque, and the bacon for appetizers! We ate those too quickly to get pics! The guys got Rib Eyes. Ladies got fillet both were stellar! The ribeye had more flavor! The sides we got we're all great. Asparagus, twice baked potato, creamed corn, and potato Gratin. For dessert, Banana Cream Pie and Pineapple upside down cake. Our bill before tip was over $400 but well worth every penny!\n",

      "The food was great! Not the best I've tasted but still up there =). I had the white fish with lump crab and it was delicious! The fish was soft and not chewy at all and the crab definitely complimented the slight saltiness of the fish. Great find!\n",

      "My family and I got the special treatment, the taste test.. It was a 6 course meal and it was just too good. First they came out with the chips, something good to pick at until more food came out.. Soup, a refreshing trio platter that consist of fruit, crab meat, and a small salad. Then a piece of salmon topped with a thinly, crunchy slice of potato on top w/ veggies and a to die for sauce.. Then lamb with risotto. The risotto wasn't cooked to my liking but I was super full to even finish this..\n",
      "\n",
      "I was finally excited for the dessert platter. It was a FULL plate of all the desserts they offered.. Pecan pie, bread pudding, a chocolate cake, cheesecake, and banana cake. My personal fave was their bread pudding and pecan pie.. Mmmmm\n",

      "Bone-In Rib Steaks\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I've had better BBQ shrimp at other Emiril's places, sauce here seemed over cooked, perhaps slightly burnt. Steaks were crazy expensive ($50!) and nothing special.  Sorry.  I can get a better steak in Houston (where I'm from) at a dozen or more places for half the price.  I'm sure the meat was high quality, and it was cooked properly... but it just wasn't anything special.  Not worthy of the $ anyway.  Service was a bit obsequious as well (which got annoying).  Overall it was a nice dinner, but for not a good value for the $.  There are many steak places in LV now, I'll try something else next time.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Started off with a Chimay Blue beer and Gumbo and progressed to a perfectly cooked ribeye steak and garlic sautéed mushrooms. Very delicious.  Especially with the Oscar style asparagus a must.  Highly recommend it.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] A high end steakhouse is about the entire experience not just the quality of the steak. The bone in ribeye was a 5 star steak, really really tasty. Wife had the pork chop and it was out of this world. Service was also good and the place was affordable as far as Vegas steakhouses go. However, the overall experience was 3 star. The place had no energy on a Friday night. Light crowd, we were put in a dark corner right next to a bunch of other people when the restaurant was half empty. Ceaser salad for 2 was $34, it was good but portion size was small. Baked potato was dry. Again, steak was incredible, rest of the experience was 3 stars. I prefer Stack steakhouse across the street at Mirage.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] What a beautiful steakhouse! A friend visiting from out of town wanted Emeril so we picked Delmonico and it was fabulous. The service was great, like we were his only table, and he had a crew, a team- they even referred to him as the \"captain.\" Fancy huh!? \n",
      "\n",
      "Ravioli app was melting in my mouth. Delicious. Fried oysters were great, and better than some Rockafeller ones I've had in New Orleans. The truffle and Parmesan chips are great, (but Wolfgang Pucks are better!) these were really thin and tasty but a bit greasy. Parmesan and potato soup absolutely creamy deliciousness. \n",
      "\n",
      "My fried chicken was huge - split it w someone. My friends steaks were great except one was overlooked and they took it off our bill, I mean obviously she didn't eat it and they did that, but no questions no rude judgements just took care of it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Great place!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The steakhouse is like most traditional steakhouses. The decor was very clean and contemporary. The hostesses weren't all that attractive and would rate about a 5-6 in my scale of looks and their demeanor looked as if they did not really care to be there at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "The dining area is half filled with patrons and business people alike chatting away about their day and how excellent the steak was prepared The beautiful burgundy high leather chairs is a nice touch and their seating area is plush and soft. The booth seating is a high suede sofa like seating and the tables were all lined with clean white linens and set in standard of most fine dining establishments. \n",
      "\n",
      "I took my seat and I was greeted by the waiter and the captain and was asked about my choice of entree. I decided to go with their Filet Mignon and go with my good instincts that this would be the best choice. The chef prepared all the appetizers for a sampling. Classic jumbo shrimp cocktail, Parmesan truffle chips, classic Caesar salad, fried calamari, and mixed green salad. \n",
      "\n",
      "The classic jumbo shrimp cocktail with a extremely spicy cocktail sauce wasn't as good as I expected. The shrimp were cooked well and the shrimp were presented beautifully, however, the spicy cocktail sauce did not please my taste buds or my nostrils for that matter. The sauce was like eating a handful of Wasabi.\n",
      "\n",
      " The extremely addicting truffle Parmesan chips were EXCELLENT and should be ordered every time any patron enters this restaurant. The chips were drizzled with truffle oils and shaved Parmesan cheese and each individual chip melted as you put them in your mouth. \n",
      "\n",
      "The classic Caesar salad had much to desire. The way the salad was prepared was not my idea of a good salad. It was literally a huge chunk of romaine lettuce with the heart in tact served with a plain and unappealing Caesar dressing. I don't like how fancy restaurants can slap a big chunk of romaine lettuce on a plate and call it a classic Caesar salad just to be different. Don't mess with a good thing!\n",
      "\n",
      "The fried calamari was ok at best, not my favorite but definitely worth a taste. The mixed green salad was a way a salad should be prepared and had just the right amount of dressing. The waiter was attentive and knew what drinks were ordered. The plates were cleared but seemed like sometimes dead plates were left around. Not a good sign of service. \n",
      "\n",
      "The entree finally came and the presentation could have been better but the Filet was ammmmazing. The steak knife cut through the Filet like a butter knife through room temperature butter. The steak was cooked to medium rare perfectly and encrusted with some New Orleans style spices. I truly enjoyed the Filet till the very last bite. One thing I do have to mention is the dessert. I would highly recommend the famous Emeril's banana cake. This thing was pure heaven and was absolutely delicious. I could not even describe it in words if I even tried so I won't! So you will have to try it for yourself. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall the experience was good, food was good but not the best I have tried, and the service was ok by my standards, but my standards can be high. My favorite parts were the Filet and the dessert, the appetizers once again could have been better with the exception of the truffle chips, mmm! delicious! I would recommend this place for dinner or lunch, however, the price can be a little daunting. I was calculating the totals of a appetizer, entree, and dessert and was estimating about 70-100 dollars a person with tip. That can look a little scary for some people, but for the meal and experience I'd say that was definitely worth it! Many thanks for reading. Till next time.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I've watched Emeril on the FoodNetwork Channel for years.. I even used to tape his shows through my VCR (yes VHS tapes). I have heard of this place through a friend that told me that everytime his brother goes to Vegas he eats here. So, when I found out that it was Emeril's Restaurant, I was even more eager to try this place! Well, I finally had the chance to experience this restaurant, whose owner is one of the most enthusiastic and giddy chef's around! \n",
      "\n",
      "I had made reservations a couple hours prior and when we got there we were seated within seconds. Place was pretty occupied with plenty of men dressed in suits, a few couples and  loud crowds that had their drunken voices echoing throughout the restaurant. All the staff members were well postured with every movement from pouring drinks to picking up finished plates off the table. The place is contemporary, a minimalist dream with large and very comfortable dining chairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The order:\n",
      "\n",
      "Vine-Ripened Tomato Salad: Tomatoes were juicy, plump and tasted so fresh. The tomatoes combined with the red onion, fresh mozzarella, extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar = 4.5/5 stars\n",
      "\n",
      "Lobster Bisque: Wow! I've had this dish a couple other times at other fancy restaurants and this one just blew those away! The flavor of the soup was smooth and had just the right amount of lobster flavor, not rich at all. Came with a few pieces of lobster.. what a tease! \n",
      "\n",
      "Potato Gratin: came in a mini pan with the whole top completely lightly crusted brown. I grabbed my fork, broke into the soft crust and scooped up bite with a little bit of everything on it (crust,  potato and cheese). One of the better potato side dishes I've ever had!\n",
      "\n",
      "Creamed Corn Gratinee: also came in a mini pan with a crumble/breaded top layer. The breading went well with the corn but overall it was just good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bone In Rib Steak: Server asked me if I wanted Emeril's Essence and slice of butter placed on my steak. I told him that I wanted it the way it should be served.. Shortly, the steak was finally served with a thin slice of butter with the evident Emeril Magic Dust \"BAM!\" sprinkled over  the meat. It was a healthy portion and did look Fantasteak! Not the softest steaks I've had but had a Nice Chew, not the juiciest but was far from dry, overall had a very well rounded quality to it. No Complaints! \n",
      "\n",
      "Emeril's Banana Cream Pie: Came Tall with layers whip cream, generous amount of banana slices, banana cream and thin crust. There was also chocolate sprinkled/shavings  on top and caramel spread on the bottom. A great way to finish a fine dinner! \n",
      "\n",
      "*Also had a glass of some French Honey Wine to compliment the pie, it was on the sweeter side but worth trying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being A FAN of Emeril For Years, Had High Expectations.. The Place Delivered but Not with Flying Colors..\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We stayed at the Palazzo and wanted to have a nice dinner at one of the restaurants in the hotel. I checked Yelp and found Delmonico had a really good review and made reservations for 9:30pm on Friday. The place was pretty full, with more and more guests still coming in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering the price of the meal and the Yelp description we put on our \"dressy\" clothes. After we were seated a group of 6 came in wearing t-shirts, baseball caps, shorts, and flip flops. Oh well, that's Vegas for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of the usual bread basket, the wait staff would place a warm roll on your plate when needed. It was one of the best rolls I've had in a while. A warm soft roll with a sprinkle of salt on top. We ordered for an appetizer, the Ahi Tuna & Salmon Tartare Cucumber Salad and Wasabi Aioli. I thought it was a bit salty, but the bf thought otherwise. We still scarfed it down. Because it was a busy night, we did have to wait a bit between the appetizer and our entrees. But the wait staff was very attentive most other times. \n",
      "\n",
      "The bf ordered the Filet Mignon. He said it was very tasty and melted in his mouth. I ordered the Roasted Rack of Colorado Lamb, Fresh Herb Popover and Black Truffle Reduction. By far the best lamb I have ever had. Previous times when I ordered lamb, it had a gamey taste. For a second, I thought I was eating filet mignon. The Black Truffle reduction has a nice addition. It did not cover up the taste of the lamb. The popover was light and airy and tasted of rosemary.  We shared the New Orleans Style Creamed Spinach as a side. It was rich, creamy and delicious. I didn't get to finish my cocktail by the end, so the waiter placed it in a \"to-go\" cup. The \"to-go\" cup being a hotel glass. \n",
      "\n",
      "If I had the money to splurge again, I'd definitely go back.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Amazing.... wine is great from a wide range, great side dishes, and on-point steak/lobster! I had the steak and my wife had the lobster\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Best bone in ribeye I've ever had. Drinks were great. Wine list is exceptional. Recommend to anyone looking for a top shelf steakhouse in Vegas.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Emeril, I am dissapointed!\n",
      "I know you have many many restaurants to take care of, but it's your name that I trusted. I'd rather you not have 4 restaurants in Vegas but 1 really great restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "I picked to go to Delmonico for  my bday lunch since I had other plans for dinner, and the fact that I love a good steak.  We arrived around 11ish and the place was dead. The service was just not good, even on a quiet day like this?!\n",
      "\n",
      "We got sitted. Waiter wasn't rude but wasn't friendly and seemed like he doesn't want to be there. He came when we were ready to order, soups and entrees and a side, then he turned to leave, but I reminded him that we haven't ordered our drinks.   The drinks are usually the first thing servers asked!!\n",
      "\n",
      "We were left alone in an empty quiet room. We got our bread from a different guy, who was a little friendlier.  But it drove me nuts because everytime he would put a roll on our plates, it was upside down.  The little round fluffy bread was facing downwards twice! I know it's not a big deal, but for the price of dining here, I expect a little more attention to details from the servers. And the butter was still frozen.\n",
      "\n",
      "My Lobster Bisque was pretty yummie. But my Filet Mignon was just average. I had to add more salt and pepper to it.  For half the price, I could get a better tasting Filet Mignon at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "My bf on the other hand had the burger, it was gigantic and very tasty. I wished I had gotten the burger instead, and it was much cheaper too.\n",
      "It wasn't the size of the meal that I was looking for, but a tasty meal with the service in par with the price we pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in the end, my steak chowing experience at Emeril's famous steakhouse was dissapointing and tasted average. If only the service were superb, it would have changed the whole experience of dining here, but unfortunately the service wasn't there either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even as we paid the check and was walking out, the lady at the front desk said thank you but was looking elsewhere, why bother?\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Delmonico's has good steak and appetizers. The atmosphere is okay and the interior design needs to be improved, but the food is delicious. The bread and butter was both cold.boo. The lobster soup was salty.eh. The barbecue shrimp is good. The rib-eye was really fatty. eh. The strip steak was yummy! The portions are big too. I wouldn't mind going back for the food, but I wasn't into their scene.\n",

      "White cheddar & bacon grits: creamy and cheesy, oh so good! \n",
      "\n",
      "Wild sauteed mushrooms: Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Pair with steak very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bone in rib eye: Nice big piece of steak with a bit of fat, which is the way I like my steak. \n",
      "\n",
      "Chateaubriand: 2 big pieces of fillet Mignon that also comes with a side of steamed asparagus and mashed potatoes finished at table side for two people. Fillet was SO tender and juicy, probably one of the best I've had! Not an asparagus person so it was bleh. Mashed potatoes were ok. \n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This was my second time here and is becoming my go to romantic spot in Vegas. The ambiance alone sets the tone for the nights experience. That staff is super welcoming in and delightful. And the steaks was cooked to perfection. Hands down one of the beat bone in ribeye steaks that I've ever tasted.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] It takes a lot for me to give 5 Yelp stars to a restaurant. I'm the type of Yelper that just loves to find things to hate about the restaurants I dine in. I love being critical, what can I say. But, as much as it pains me to say this, I didn't find one thing I hated about Delmonico Steakhouse. (ARGH!!)\n",
      "\n",
      "The lobster bisque. Excellent. Best lobster bisque I've ever had in my life. Hands down. Add a little bit of cracked pepper on top and you have a wonderful tasting starter complete with its generous portion of lobster meat. I should've asked for a second order of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "My ribeye was perfectly cooked and flavorful. Ribeye is usually a cut of meat with a good amount of fat on it. My ribeye had the perfect balance of meat and fat. Fat means flavor, people! I was glad I didn't have to cut off too much of it from my meat. We ordered a side of roasted fingerling potatoes (w/ whole garlic and fresh herbs) and buttered fresh broccoli. These sides complimented my ribeye very well, but I'm being a little biased here because broccoli and fingerling potatoes are my favorite veggies (#1 and #2, respectively). I couldn't finish the massive 16 oz. piece of meat and the sides, so I took them all to go. I wound up eating the rest of it for breakfast the next morning. Can you say best breakfast ever? Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from a patron at the restaurant that was loud and sounded like Mr. Krabs from Spongebob Squarepants, my dining experience here was top notch! I couldn't ask for more from the food, service, and ambiance. You're welcome, Delmonico Steakhouse...\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Rib eye steak for $51 should be pretty darn good.  What I got was not as tender and not as flavorful as the rib eye served by our local Texas Roadhouse.  And, of course almost three times the cost.  Actually, more than three times the cost, since the entrée comes all by itself, and you pay separately for any sides.  My wife's pork chop was huge, but virtually raw in the center.  The server explained to us that this was the \"correct\" way to serve pork nowadays.  Apparently we're behind the times, because we prefer not to eat raw pork.  She did enjoy the part of the chop that was cooked, though.  By the way, my steak was a bit more than lukewarm.  I kind of like steak that's hot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant was very loud, and became substantially noisier as the table of eight drunks behind us got more and more drunk.  Shouting, screaming, maniacal laughter filled the section of the restaurant where we, unfortunately, were seated near them.  No one from the Delmonico's staff or management did anything to ameliorate this situation, and the drunks stayed (and got louder) long after they had finished eating.  But not finished drinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is one of those steak houses where there's a primary server and then a team of two or three ancillary servers.  None of them were initially friendly, although the primary server warmed up a bit.  The others came and went almost instantaneously, with minimal contact.  For example, one server brought a couple of small popovers for each of us.  Almost tossing them onto plates, he muttered \"Enjoy your bread\" -- and was gone.  A small magic act, more impressive than the food.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really can't think of any reason for us to go back, and would not recommend this place to anyone.  But your mileage may vary.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I'm not a chaser of celebrity chefs...and wasn't excited to hit up Emerils joint in V-town. But I have to say. I was diggin' this place. \n",
      "\n",
      "The atmosphere is pretty chill and classy. It made me want to sip cognac and smoke a cigar ( and I don't like either of those). This place definitely exudes a mid-western meets Palm Springs sort of vibe. You know... big comfy, light taupe leather chairs, with hearty dark wood tables and high nicely lit ceilings. \n",
      "\n",
      "My food was good. The Foie Gras was amazing, the endive  salad was nice but not out of this world and the lamb special was good too. With very hearty servings of meat I couldn't finish my lamb, though if it were outrageously good I probably would have. \n",
      "\n",
      "And yes if offered to me, I sampled the dishes from around the table). Of note: the bone-in rib eye was very nice and the fondue was ridiculously good. I passed on the fish. (Come on Craig - who orders fish at a steakhouse?) Between the foie gras, fondue and lamb, it's amazing I walked out on my own. Never fear... red wine was there to save my ateries. (Whew! )\n",

      "We sat a few tables away from D. Rodman. It's amazing how grown men in their 50's will say shout out stupid stuff like: \"Yo D.R.? Can I get a Whoop Whoop?\" when they're in the presence of an ex pro athlete. Funny stuff.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Not only is it not the \"best\" it's not even that good. I am a steak eater. I frequent great steakhouses. This is not one.  WAY over prices for quality. There are several great steaks in Vegas. Do yourself a favor and skip this one\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I usually love Delmonicos but my last trip kept me wanting more. Maybe I was too hungover to thoroughly enjoy my meal, but on this blurry Saturday night everything was very mediocre for me. We started off with the steak tartare and the bbq shrimp. The steak tartare was very good. It was fresh, clean and delicious. The bbq shrimp was good, but for $18 for 4 shrimps, I wanted them to be a party in my mouth, and in this case, they were not. I ordered a medium rare rib eye. It was cooked to absolute perfection. Nice crust and juicy pink center. I marveled at the perfection of my steak. Although it was slightly under seasoned it was still juicy and delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Delmonico's is probably one of the best if not thee best steakhouses I've been to. Their service is spectacular and on point every time I've been. They really do hire the best of the best. Attentive but not overbearing servers.  Delmonicos puts out some amazing and good quality food. If you go, you must try their lobster bisque, it's luscious, creamy and definitely worth the calories. Potato gratin is definitely one of their best sides also. And of course, don't every steer from what you came for, the STEAK!\n",

I did not even need a knife to cut the steak.  The steak was melt in your mouth delicious.  The bacon wilted spinach salad is bomb!  I have never enjoyed a salad or steak this good.  I make it a point to stop by this place when I am in Vegas.  \n",

Why the hell would you serve it if the quality was not up to standards.  After issues with food we were treated like crap.  Not impressed. There are tons of good restaurants in Vegas. Don't waste you time or hard earned money!\n",

I don't mind paying for good food but the steak is average, The place is nice but our table is right by the kitchen. If i mentioned is a birthday celebration when I made the reservation then at least a good table location. They made no effort to even mention \"Happy Birthday\" to my husband.  Joe's is much better. Never come back.\n",

Perhaps here in Las Vegas the guests are a bit abusive , that may account for the latent attitude .  Mind you , they don't display it to your face , but if You keep your ears and eyes open ,  you can easily pick up on the glares and hushed cross talk between them .

The main course was the absolute worst. Three pieces of meat per person, and it was barely lukewarm. I saw our server \"heat\" it up for maybe 3 seconds, and then take it off the grill. Although the meat was flavorful, the fact that it was almost COLD ruined the whole meal. Not only that, I asked our server to take a picture of us since it was my bday, and he handed over my camera to another server as if he was too good to take a damn picture!\n",

Just a large open room with many tables and many people chatting and laughing. We ordered the bone-in ribeye and it was prepared to perfection, but a tad bit too salty for my friend's taste. I loved mine, but you need to be a full-on caveman to eat the whole damn thing. We had the creamed spinach which was coarse and tough to chew and the au gratin potatoes were really good. The sommelier was great and recommended a very nice blend. We were so stuffed, we chose not to have dessert, but they looked quite good. This is a very nice, fancy steakhouse, but CUT still gets my vote for the best one around.\n",

The food and service were both certainly good, but....I don't know....something was lacking.  It may have been the atmosphere.  Everything seemed very bland and sort of old - for instance, the leather dining chairs all had cracks and chips in them, which isn't what I expect from a place of this caliber.  I guess it just wasn't a very special experience.\n",

      "Service:  Very Good.  We had at least 3-4 servers taking care of us (party of 5) throughout the night.  Initially dinner was for a party of 4.  However, once we were seated, our buddy landed at the airport and decided to join us.  I informed the head server (thinking that they may not be able to accommodate) and he immediately converted the table to seat 5 (pulled out stuff from the bottom to make it a round table).  Water was constantly filled and table cleared off in appropriate fashion.\n",
      "Food:  We started off with the Caesar Salad and Ahi Tuna/Salmon tartare.  I thought the salad was just ok.  A tad too much dressing.  Same with the tartare.  Nothing special and pretty bland.  Most of the group got the bone in rib eye (medium rare to medium well).  All were cooked well.  I thought the medium rare tasty pretty good.  Nothing spectacular about it, just good steak.  I had the rack of lamb (medium rare) and it had decent flavors.  I would take Carvino's lamb chops over it any day.  The sides we had were decent (Potato gratin, mushrooms, and corn).  We had a nice bottle of wine that the Sommelier recommended with a price point of $85.  That was probably the best tasting thing of the night.\n",
      "The verdict on Delmonico's is that it is a decent steakhouse that it's reputation is based on its name more than its food.  I would choose CUT over it any day.  They have more selection of meat (cuts and quality).\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This place is a solid four star restaurant.  The decor was modern and minimalist.  Our server helpful and attentive.  The food was great.  We started off with Emeril's cajun BBQ shrimp.  They were just enough to hold us over, a little overcooked, but seasoned to perfection.  My girlfriend had a fillet of halibut over a sweet potato risotto and I had the 22 oz bone in steak rib eye.  I had a taste of the sweet potato risotto, and I thought it was delicately sweet with an interesting flavor.  The halibut  was, well, halibut.  My steak, on the other hand, was a real treat.  The bone does weigh the steak down a bit, but it was still thick and juicy.  It also came with three dipping sauces, which were tasty, but also masked the flavor of the beef.  I'd say use them sparingly.  Another complaint about the actual bone was that it kept the steak from being cooked evenly, one side was noticeably bloodier than the other.  In all, our dinner came out to about $150.  I think for a hearty meal with clean presentation accompanied by wine, not a bad deal, but not a home run either.\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I went to Delmonico with a large group for a friend's birthday recently.  There were about 20 of us, split up over 3 circular tables.  It would have been great to have one long table, but I understand the constraint.  We were seated as soon as the birthday girls arrived after having a drink at the bar.  The service was excellent!  There were a lot of us and the staff was courteous and knowledgable about the menu and the wine list.  \n",

      "Let me preface my review of the food by saying that I don't eat red meat.  I know steak is their speciality, so I was knowing order what they don't go best.  I started with the shrimp cocktail, which included 4 large shrimp, cocktail sauce and some garnish.  The shrimp were cooked very well, but it was a regular shrimp cocktail.  The cajun marinade imparted a little extra kick, but nothing remarkable.  Next, I had the snapper entree.  Almost everyone else at my table ordered the rib eye, which was enormous.  Like Man vs. Food big.  The piece of snapper looked so tiny in the bowl next to the big steaks!  In all honesty though, it was a regular portion.  The lentils were a great addition, as were the brussel sprouts.  However, the fish seemed to have been sitting out for a while.  The top was dry like it had been under the heat lamps.  I understand that it's tough to coordinate one peice of fish when you have to prepare 15+ rib eyes for the same set of tables, but that snapper still cost me $40.  I didn't have dessert since we brought a cake, but the coffee at the end was good.  I'm not saying that I wouldn't return to Delmonico, but knowing there are so many other steakhouses in Vegas that have a stronger reputation for seafood, if it's my choice, I'd probably choose to go elsewhere.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Pricey, but worth it. I tried the pan roasted salmon with sweet corn &  crab vinaigrette and fresh basil- of coarse with mashed potatoes :), the Cesar salad and a shared Apple Fritter desert with pecan pie.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Celebrated Labor Day weekend in Vegas and was looking for a good steakhouse. This place was high quality and great service. I ordered the salmon but substituted the potato and andouille sausage hash for mashed potatoes since I don't eat red meat or pork, and held off of the homemade Worcestershire sauce. The onion rings on the top were delicious, I could have eaten a plate of them! My boyfriend got the bone in rib eye and my friends ordered the Caesar salad for two (kinda pricey ~$34 - but good) and a steak and salmon. This will be one of my top restaurants I'll be going to when I go back to Vegas.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I am a foodie.  I have watched many a show from Lagrasse.  I had expectations that were not made.  Service was great, ambience was good.  I had the petite lettuce wedge... ok.  I had the BBQ Salmon.  Was not impressed.  It was cooked to the stated level, cut of fish was good but the BBQ was not good and the sausage potatoe hash was lacking.  For the price of the dinner , it was not worth it.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This place was great. We came with a party of 12. We chose the restaurant based on the wine list and this had one of the best on the strip. The gumbo was good. The filet was great. The only part I didn't enjoy was the oysters. We mentioned it to two different waiters and only ate about 6 of the 12 oysters. We were all a little upset and we spent $1500 on dinner and they couldn't take the oysters we didn't care for off the bill.\n",
      "\n",

      "The service was great - Todd, Jennifer, and Nicole were very attentive and personable. Our biggest complaint was the food. The heirloom tomato salad was good which isn't saying much, but the steak was underwhelming.  The rack of lamb was probably the best dish we ordered, despite being a steakhouse. \n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered two bone in rib eyes, a bone in New York strip, and a rack of lamb. The steaks were under seasoned and lacked that beefy flavor you'd expect from a steak.

To start, the tuna and salmon tartare was amazing, along with a delicious cheese plate! We were pleasantly surprised most of the cheeses were from marin county, ca where we live and work! Two of us got salads, they were fresh and crisp and not over dressed. The steaks for our entrées were AMAZING.  I got the special which was a surf and turf filet mignons and shrimps, my coworker got the 100% Japanese wagyu and it MELTED the second it hit my tongue. The most delicious rib eye we have ever had! And for dessert we split a slice of key lime pie. Yum!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We love this place.  We dined here on March 5, 2015.  It holds a special place in our hearts.  We started with the caesar salad for two which was prepared table side, so fresh and good.  The steaks are always better than we remember.  We had the bone in ribeyes medium rare and they melted in our mouths.  The desserts are always fantastic too.  We went here on our yearly Vegas trip which we do for our half anniversary every year.  Can not say enough about this restaurant!  Love love.  There was one not so great side dish and it seemed like it was only ours....the potato au gratin was burnt and dry, not a good combo and we should have sent it back.  Everyone else's that went by our table looked fantastic.  Our bad, we should have sent it back....but o well...just don't order that dish.  We had a great evening and the service was excellent as always.\n",

It did have  bland all white decor in the main dining that reminded me of 2001 a Space Odyssey 's Discovery One with  really dim lights. Good thing the steaks were from another universe also! It had to have been the largest ribeye I have ever ordered for one person, and It came with a slab of butter!  Really it needs more butter? It was well marbled, thick with a little char (key !),  and it had a wonderful juicy flavor. It  was extremely good as I was so full about 3/4 of the way through, but as in \"man vs food\" i trudged on ! I have to say it was a fantastic to eat, but i did feel like a hundred pounds heavier throughout the evening! Try the steak.... try the bone in Ribeye steak.... did I mention you should try the steak?  then next time maybe have something else..... if you dare!\n",

We were told that it was no problem and they were happy to have us as long as we like.  We were never once rushed or pushed out like at a lot of places just trying to turn tables even though we were there 2-3 hours.  The service was amazing but not to the point where you were harrassed...our drinks were never empty and plates never sat long but it seems we never noticed the waiter coming and going which is awesome.  We took our time with drinks, appetizers, and dinner and all were timed perfectly and served when we were ready.  The food was amazing as well!  I had the escargot and the bone-in ribeye which was the best steak I have ever had!  I have had a lot of steaks from so called steakhouses and top recommended restaurants, this is definitely tops!  My wife had the lobster bisque and king crab legs which were also absolutely delicious.  The prices are higher, but it goes directly with the service and quality of food and I have no problem paying for what we got.  We will definitely go back...now if we could only catch Emeril there!\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] my bf and i were totally looking forward to dining at delmonico.  i like fancy dining, he likes meat, put it together and we usually go to a steakhouse.  however, i did look at the menu beforehand, and noticed there were no crab cakes.  i always have crab cakes before a filet!  so that's probably where the problem started.  i made a reservation a couple months in advance on open table, but even then i could only get a 5:30 rez.  i'm not sure of the entire layout, but it seemed like we were seated in a more private room, which was nice.  the areas we passed through were super loud (staff and wedding party of 20).  gorgeous giant leather seats.  we started off with the \"creole boiled gulf shrimp cocktail with tomato horseradish sauce and homemade crackers\".  there was definitely some BAM in the sauce.  very peppery and lingers.  the crackers were just as spicy, but why are crackers served anyway?  the shrimp itself didn't taste like it was prepared in any special way.  bf had a bone in strip.  i order one of the specials, kobe sirlon.  i'm sorry this had to be my first experience with kobe.  it was TERRIBLE.  pretty on the plate, thinly sliced, with sinewy strands running all through it.  i was mortified with all the chewing.  i partially blame myself.  i knew i should have stuck with my standard filet medium rare.  sigh.  and now i will probably never go back to delmonico.  the sides consisted of overly buttery country smashed potatoes and tiny fried bay scallops (tasted past its prime to me).  we also ordered an additional side of asparagus, also too buttery.  emeril's banana cream pie was good though.  intricately placed bananas seemed to float between layers of banana cheesecake.  the service is decent, but a bit impersonal.  we made a huge stain on the white tablecloth with a piece of dropped meat, and i expected the server to make a joke at least.  total damage, including tip, no drinks, was $195.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Given the high price point of the steakhouse, it would have taken a much better steak to justify a five-star rating. I had the bone-in ribeye, which was solid and my date had a petite filet, which was also solid -- but nothing fantastic. The salads were also fairly good, and the creamed corn was amazing. We were too stuffed for dessert, but all in all, a good meal.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This is the 3rd time we've been to Delmonico & honestly, it keeps getting better! The service is top notch.  Our servers were on top of everything but not intrusive & the manager, Rene, was friendly  & knowledgeable about all aspects of the restaurant.  For our appetizers, we had oysters on the 1/2 shell, wilted spinach salad & heirloom tomato soup.  All were yummy.  We've come to realize that splitting a steak between 3 people is the way to go.  In the past, half our steak would go to waste as these steaks are huge!  We split a bone in ribeye and there was still a couple of pieces left over. The reason you get so full is because the sides at Delmonico are out of this world! This time around we had the potatoes au gratin, creamed spinach & creamed corn.  I could make a meal on Delmonico side dishes alone - they're that good!  While they've served up delicious desserts in the past (what? No more bread pudding?), we just didn't have room for dessert this time.  I can't wait until we are back in Vegas again & have the time to stop by this gem of a restaurant.  It's true culinary bliss!\n",

      "Three of us enjoyed two ribeyes ($52) and one filet ($46). Waiter told us their ribeye is the best steak in Vegas, but don't believe it. They were cooked correctly. The rub was rather bland and the crusting on the filet was hard. On a scale of one to ten, my ribeye overall was a 7. I've had 10's before in Vegas, so the competition is tough!

      "With so many great places in Vegas, you can do much better. Everything else was top notch, but the food is the core of the experience and Delmonicos is just average, unfortunately.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] While staying at the Palazzo in Vegas during the CES & AEE convention's I had a great dinner at Delmonico's with a few new friends on a Friday night.\n",
      "We did not make a reservation for the 4 of us, but the maitre' d Marty put a table together for us in about a 5 min wait. The place was packed!\n",
      "I guess it's the perk of being with \"high rollers\" aka \"corporate cocks\".\n",
      "No, but seriously we had unbelievable service thanks to Marty's personal touch & our beautiful hostess Corrine. \n",
      "Our C.C's did the pleasure of doing the ordering for us ladies. I must give my C.C's credit because these 2 men had great taste!\n",
      "We started with a very nice bottle of Pinot Noir, Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp, Truffle Parmesan Potato Chips, Lobster Bisque, a really good salad that was not on the menu per the request of my C.C friend Richard.\n",
      "The lobster bisque was interesting, the chef bakes the lobster into a tasty biscuit that you can dip or crumble into the creamy bisque. \n",
      "We also had Butternut Squash Ravioli both dishes brought me back to Delmonico's for 2nd's on Sunday night. Again, I was lucky enough to have Corrine as my hostess the 2nd time around. Thanks Corrine : )\n",
      "Our main course we had a very fine bottle of Cabernet not on the wine list but one of our Maitre' d Marty's personal fav's!\n",
      "We each had the Bone In Ribeye Steak's they were huge!! Gigantor!!! \n",
      "I ate maybe a 1/4 of it!! \n",
      "To compliment our BIG juicy rib eyes we had Vegetables of the Day & New Orleans Creamed Spinach. D'lish!\n",
      "We had sooo much food I thought I was going to burst!\n",
      "All though we were all stuffed some how we managed to end our meal with some coffee & dessert's,  Emeril's Banana Cream Pie (my personal fav. FYI I love cream pies ; p) & Chocolate Peanut Butter Torte. So sinful..... but not as sinful as two women in vegas baby!! \n",
      "What happens in Vegas stay's in Vegas!!!\n",
      "Let's just say our date's were not cheap and our bill was not small $$$$.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Ate at the bar here and had a great experience.  Service was attentive and the food delicious.  Ordered the bone in ribeye --- enjoyed the spice rub and the meat was very tender.  Sides of broccoli and mushrooms were great.  And for a Las Vegas steakhouse, the prices were not obnoxious (a la the nearby Cut).   The banana cream pie is incredible --- great way to end your meal.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] A great steak dinner in the Venetian/Palazzo resort on a cool desert night on the Las Vegas Boulevard--It does not get any better than this.  Do not miss the gumbo, and tomato salad for starters.  I love the bone in ribeye, and the bone in prime rib.  I have not been to Delmonico's in quite a few years.  As usual Emeril Lagasse's  restaurants never disappoint me, I once again enjoyed my meal.  The ribeye here is beyond compare.  For dessert do not miss Emeril's banana creme pie--my all-time favorite dessert.  BAM!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We ate dinner for our Anniversary and lunch on our final day. Food was so tasty and my hubby is still raving about the Bone-in steak, the salmon was moist and succulent. Jumbo prawn cocktail, lobster bisque, lobster sliders, specialty drinks Tale of Two Cherries Oysters on half shell... I can go on and on Rene, Lamont and Dominique were top notch service experts!!  #vegasfinedining #betterthandelicious\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This was my third time at an Emeril restaurant, and once again I left feeling that paying $85 to eat dinner was perfectly justified.\n",
      "\n",
      "Appetizer: The traditional New Orleans gumbo.  Smokey, spicy, warm, and comforting.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Entree: Filet mignon, medium.  Crusted with just the right amount of spices, cooked to perfection, and crowned with a healthy pat of herb butter.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Side Dish: Country smashed potatoes.  Clearly filled with more butter and cream than I care to think about, skins left in (love that), and just melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  \n",
      "\n",
      "My friend's side dish: Bacon & cheese grits.  I normally don't like grits, but these were nice and well...gritty, not runny or gloppy.  Add bacon and cheese...c'mon.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Dessert: The best part of the meal.  Wait--probably the best part of my entire Vegas trip.  Warm pecan pie with an oatmeal shortbread cookie crust, topped with homemade vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce.  Just...wow.  The pecans were chopped into manageable pieces, the filling was not overly thick and cloying, and I could have eaten the crust by itself and been happy.  I had a taste of my friend's chocolate bread pudding, which was gooey and intensely chocolatey, but not too sweet.  (It tasted like a combo of semi-sweet & bittersweet.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Drinks: Pretty good.  They don't have a specialty cocktail list since they are very into being a traditional steakhouse, but my pineapple martini was nice.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Decor: Very bare bones- the plain beige walls have no art on them, but that allows you to notice the very ornate architecture of the place, with high ceilings and arches everywhere.  I was too into my food to really care what it looked like though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service: As always with Emeril's restaurants- impeccable.  We had no less than 3 people taking care of us at all times: one to take our orders, one to bring our food, and one to take it away.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Tip: SHARE an entree.  I split the 9.5 oz. filet mignon with my friend and I'm glad I did.  The average portion is enough for 2 or 3 people.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Loved Delmonico!! Everything was amazing. The Banana Creme Pie was to die for and the truffle fries & brussel sprouts are some of the best I've ever had.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Excellent in every way! =)\n",
      "\n",
      "There are so many servers. =X  I think they have a server per person, or per utensil used haha.\n",
      "\n",
      "Environment: Dim, Classy Place.  Dress Nice.\n",
      "Great for evening & Dinners.\n",
      "\n",
      "Absolutely no complaints, but an extra thanks to a friend's bday that I got the chance to eat here. =)\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My husband and I have enjoyed Emeril's restaurants. But when we tried Delmonico's, it was unbelievable. We had the best meal ever. It's worth the money. I think it's the best of all Emeril's restaurants. I have no more words, speachless. You all should to try it.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We expected much better. The design of this restaurant is great, the service is great but the steaks are not great. They started us with a complimentary thin slice of cucumber topped with tiny lentils, a tasty tidbit. We then had the lobster bisque which was very good with large chunks of lobster in it. My husband had the bone- in NY strip,medium rare, it was grizzly and very chewy, not worth a price tag of $50. I had the petite Piedmontese filet mignon, 6oz., although extremely small for $50.00 it was very good. We were then given a small scoop of complimentary blood orange sorbet and finished the meal with the pecan pie, good but not memorable. With all the steakhouses in Vegas we have no reason to return here.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Delmonico Steakhouse is at the Venetian.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the Venetian lost my luggage last summer (see my Venetian reviews for the entire story) I swore I wouldn't step foot in the Venetian. It pains me to admit this, but I stepped foot in the Venetian during my most recent Vegas trip :(  Just to clarify, this was NOT by choice, but by circumstance. Me, my boyfriend, and 2 other couples wanted to do a nice dinner. Long story short, one of the other couples raved about this restaurant and made dinner reservations for all of us. \n",
      "\n",
      "With that being said, this steakhouse blew me away. It was surprisingly really good.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**APPETIZERS: I had the French Onion Soup and my boyfriend had a salad. The appetizers were so-so. We definitely could've have done without ordering them since our entrees and sides were filling.\n",
      "\n",
      "**ENTREES: My boyfriend and I each ordered the Bone in Ribeye. Had we known how HUGE they were, we would've just ordered one and shared. I was surprised at how good my steak was. I wanted to pull a \"Fred Flinstone\" and pick up the steak with my hands and gnaw on the entire thing.  My steak was prepared well, seasoned well, and tasted delicious. Even with all that deliciousness there was just so much meat that neither of us finished our steaks. \n",
      "\n",
      "**SIDES: We had the Creamed Corn Gratin & Potato Gratin. Both of which were creamy and delicious.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The service was fine, the ambiance was nice, the steak and sides were fantastic. I'm just annoyed that this restaurant is located in the Venetian -_-\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] From the get go, Delmonico was wonderful. We were introduced to a couple people taking care of us that evening. They made sure we were completely taken care of throughout the whole experience.  We chose a bottle of a wine for the meal and it paired perfectly. The wine list was the most extensive list I had seen in a long time. It was all broken down by style of wine and where the grapes originated from. Then we chose the house salad to pair with a half dozen oysters. The oysters were absolutely wonderful and the dressing for the house salad was great as well. I ordered crab crusted medallions and my boyfriend ordered the filet. Both came out perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth. We were too stuffed to take on the desert menu but the overall experience at Delmonico was delicious. I would recommend to anyone and everyone.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Always reliable, like you old Ramington 870.\n",
      "Great service, outstanding wine list. \n",
      "Skip the appetizers and go for a streak and salads\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I came here for a bachelor party, and there were some mixed reviews in my crowd.  Most would give this place a 3-star review, but I thought that it deserved a 4-star review.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most in my crowd thought that the steaks were poorly decorated.  But I was not sure what they expected - steak is steak.  And my filet tasted well enough.  It was cooked well for a medium rare plus, which is hard to do.  So I was impressed enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also shared salmon with someone, but that definitely could have used more salt.  That surprised me considering that this is Emerald's restaurant, where butter and salt is what he *BAM!* loves.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I had some sides here that I thought were pretty amazing.  The buttered and gratin'd corn here is delicious.  My friends other hand, felt underwhelmed by their mushrooms and asparagus, which I guess I would have to tend to agree.\n",
      "\n",
      "They did have an excellent wine list, however.  I got some bottles of Shafer Relentless for less than double the retail price, which is a great deal considering that I was at an upper-end steakhouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, what is noteworthy is that this tends to be a pretty good scene.  So not a bad place for a bachelor's party.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Enjoyed the service typically expected for a nice Vegas restaurant.  I ate the rib eye steak cooked medium and was mouth watering.  The portion was big which I had to take home.  The environment is great for a dinner party, but may be loud for a date (we dined on a Wed night).\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Had a wonderful dinner here with my husband and friends for his birthday. All of our food was excellent, well prepared. There only reason for 4 stars is the service was a bit too slow and inconsistent. I.E. our drink order was taken at 3 different times so we all received our drinks at different times. All in all, great food, ok service.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I was in Las Vegas with my fiancé while he was attending a wireless convention for his company.  I asked a friend to recommend a good restaurant to go to while we were there.  From his short list of about 5, we chose Delmonico's.  Delmonico's is at the Venetian in the Palazzo with about 50 other shops & restaurants.  Attire was business casual.  The dining room was dimly lit and elegant.  They treat you with table side service, and very personal attention from no less than 3 attendants.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wine list was impressive and started out with Kevin's picks (the sommelier).  I noticed the by the glass section only had about 5 different wines on it. Apparently this wasn't a by the glass kind of place!  Their wine list also boasted many 'cult' wines like Screaming Eagle and Harlan.  Although Twomey Merlot was on the list, we soon found that they had sold out already.  Our maitre d', Lamont, said he was a very big fan and recommended it frequently.  Kevin came by our table to meet us and said he wasn't aware they were out of the Merlot and that he would be ordering more that week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Delmonico's is a classic American steakhouse with Creole influences.  I couldn't decide between the crab cake, the ahi tuna & salmon tartare & the New Orleans BBQ shrimp so our waiter suggested the shrimp; said it was their signature starter and I was so glad he did.  It was amazing! I also had the filet. It was cooked perfectly, creole seasoned, medium rare (the color was consistently the same shade through the entire cut) and it melted like butter in your mouth. The service was exquisite.  There was a maitre d' & a waiter for every 3 tables and we were given a lot of attention.  For dessert, I had chocolate brioche bread pudding with Hawaiian vintage chocolate ice cream & fudge. When our server came back to check on us, I thought maybe I had a look of sheer ecstasy on my face, but he had said he knew how good  it was and wanted to make sure I was enjoying it as much as he does.  We surprised Lamont by telling him we were leaving him wine; he thanked us for our generosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am giving Delmonico's 5 stars, each of which I feel they are very worthy of.  Dining here was not cheap, or even close to being on budget, ($450 for 2 people) but it was fantastic.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Fantastic evening. Had the bone in rib eye and it was cooked perfectly. I usually ask for steak sauce but not this time. Also had the BBQ shrimp for a appetizer. I would definitely go back again. Side note: Larry our waiter was great. Guess he could tell we were from Hawaii when we ask questions about the menu. He's from Kaneohe but moved here 17 years ago.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I've been wanting to come here for years. My husband and I like to try steak houses around Las Vegas and this one had been on our list for a while. He decided to take me for Mother's Day this year. It actually wasn't as great as I expected.  I heard so many great things about this place but I would give it an \"OK.\"  It's good, but we have been to better steak houses. I ordered the bone in ribeye. It was cooked perfectly though. Kudos to the chef. The best part was dessert!  The pecan pie was delish!! I probably wouldn't come back here again, though. There's other places that I enjoy much more for the same price.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I brought my two friends visiting from London to Delmonico's. Having never been there before I was a bit nervous. No need for nerves here.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had an excellent wait staff take care of us. You are not there for the decor but for the food so don't judge this book by its cover.\n",
      "\n",
      "My friends each ordered the filet and I the rib eye. We also ordered the lobster bisque, the creamed spinach (a must), broccoli and fingerling potatoes. Everything was divine. My friends both wanted to cry over how perfect their filets were. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have no idea what wine we had but all in all I could not have asked for a nicer meal. I recommend it for the experience of going as well as the wonderful food.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another plus is people were dressed for a nice dinner and not in casual shorts and such. The mealk ran about $100.00 per person after everything.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Initial visit:  Love the bone-in-rib eye.  Tasty and huge.  I could only finish half.  Probably one the best tasting steaks I've had.  I've been to a lot of high end steakhouses and this is one of the few places that really stood out and make me want to return.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second visit:  Second time was a disappointment.  Steak was too buttery and oily.  Was not as memorable as the first time to make me want to come back again with so many other options in Vegas.  The ambiance is nice.  Service impeccable.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This popular dining spot deserves its reputation as the best steakhouse in Vegas. The ribeye steak was as good as it gets. The house special bacon-wrapped quail was cooked to perfection. But the banana cream pie was horrible. It almost seemed like we were served a slice that was two weeks old - Very dry and not very creamy.\n",
      "Too bad the meal ended with luke warm coffee and no refills to wash down the pie. I have to say the service was uneven, like we were an afterthought once dessert was served.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We went here for lunch during a conference held at the Venetian.  We made reservations for 5, but did not need them on a Friday around lunch time.  The wait staff was friendly and very attentive to our needs.  I started with the gumbo.  At first it had a burnt taste, which seemed to go away as I ate more of the dish.  I had the chopped salad for lunch, which was huge and had lot of everything in it.  I'm not sure if there is a separate lunch menu from the dinner menu, but I did find out bill quite pricey considering it was for lunch and no one had a steak!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] HORRIBLE.  absolutely horrible.  i've had dental surgeries that were more enjoyable than this evening and paying the bill was like paying taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "i know a lot of yelpers have had good experiences and i apologize if i'm bringing those down.  but for us, we called months in advance to make reservations.  because of a show we were to attend we had to have dinner late that evening.  so in making the reservations we asked the person if that would be a problem.  we had no desire to be rushed through dinner and out of the restaurant, so we would have changed our plans if it would have been an issue.  she told us, \"oh no problem, absolutely no problem.\".  we even told her what our worries about a late reservation were and again she assured us, \"no problem\".  so when we got there we ordered salads and wine.  i noticed the waiter kept pushing us to order so i told him \"we'd like to finish our salads before we order\".  sure enough.....\"well our kitchen is going to close in 15-minutes so you have to place your order now\".  what do you do?  i'd already ordered a $200.00 bottle of wine.  so we ordered our meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "although the steak was good the vegetables looked like they had sat on the stove most of the evening.  the potato was so cold it wouldn't even melt the butter they shoved in it.  i couldn't believe it.  i managed to get through most of the steak, giving up when all around me the wait staff started setting up tables for the next day.  you would think at a minimum they would have left the lights turned down low so we could have enjoyed our meal with some sense of ambience.  but i guess the wait staff wouldn't have been able to see the glasses they were polishing at every table around us.  literally every table around us.  of course the music was turned off once the lights came up so we got to listen to all their conversations for entertainment.\n",
      "\n",
      "our waiter was arrogant border-lining on rude.  this one is funny, get this....when i asked for a wine recommendation he actually looked at me and said, \"how much would you like to spend.  $50.00?\".  residing in hawaii we were in dress aloha wear but i assure you we didn't look like we were going to try to pay with food stamps.  when we were seated he was so kind and cordial to the table of young ladies next to us i was surpised at what we got out of him.  i guess i should have strapped on some boobs to increase our chances of decent respectable service.     \n",
      "\n",
      "i think the worse fallout from this experience for me is now i don't want to waste time or energy going to one of the major chef's restaurants.  i mean this was emeril's place for god sakes.  i'm originally from the south and understand southern hospitality, which i thought emeril attempts too express in everything he does.  i assure you it doesn't exist in this place.  this restaurant has literally turned me against \"fine dining\".  i should have went to the hard rock and saved $350.00.  \n",
      "\n",
      "anyone know where i can buy strap-on boobs?  i might want to try fine dining again sometime.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This place is by far the best restaurant for impeccable service and incredible food. From start to finish, EVERYTHING was spot on. Nobody is perfect, but this place... this place is the definition of Perfection. From the smiling hostesses to the personable server, Frank, that not only was warm and welcoming, but even wholeheartedly supported their participation for Restaurant Week. Even explained what Three Square was all about and let us know that the portion of each meal is donated to help the hunger. He genuinely wanted us to participate and even had the RW menu to show us when we sat down. Not like some other steakhouse server *coughcough (Smith&W) that hid this menu unless you mention it and when you do, they treat you cold as winter. Not at this place, you feel like family or a special guest at someone's house. And this is just lunch for crying out loud. Service felt like you're the most important person in the world. Amazing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank was delightful to have as our server. He was informative, attentive, enthusiastic, and just had this kind, easy going presence about him. Getting to know my Father and I throughout our dining experience. It was so nice to have a server that actually wanted to know more about their guests. He was thrilled that we came for Restaurant Week and when I started ordering, he would say.. that's my favorite too love the burrata cheese or after I ordered the Prime hamburgers.. he would say.. that burger is so juicy and delicious, you'll love it. It felt so good that the server is all for it. Even his assistant said thank you each time she took a dish or utensils away. So sweet and kind!\n",
      "\n",
      "The goods... Everything. There wasn't a single thing that was mediocre. Complimentary bread was like a light croissant mixed with herbs. The appetizers.. My Father had the Heirloom Tomato Soup With Grilled Ricotta Cheese Sandwich, which was so good.. I didn't even get a chance to taste not even one bite of it. He was enjoying it so much that I didn't have the heart to interrupt his food romance. Sh*t. I just wanted one bite!!! *sigh OH well.. I ended up enjoying the Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad with my favorite Burrata Cheese, Red onion, Balsamic Vinegar, and Torn Local Basil. It was oh so freshly made. That burrata cheese just makes my day. Loved every single bite of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you come here for RW... a must try.. DELMONICO'S PRIME HAMBURGER. On Toasted Brioche Roll With Fries, Cheddar Cheese, and Bacon. I never in my life had a hamburger like this one. It was first class, first rate, love at first bite. Outstanding flavors. Even the sesame seed bun tasted buttery and oh so soft. So good, so good, unbelievably Deeeeelicious. The size of this burger was enormous. My Father had to cut it up like a steak to eat it. Me, on the other hand ate it like a champ. I was full from eating only half of it, so was my Father. The presentation itself was like art. Even cutting it in half was beautiful. I'll be daydreaming about this burger probably for the rest of my life. My Father kept on laughing, either from the sight of happiness of seeing this magnificent burger or he can't get over how huge this is. Either way, he was enjoying himself and that makes me extremely happy to see. We, both had a splendid time here. \n",
      "\n",
      "Both desserts were wonderful.  The Banana Cream Pie Parfait with Caramel Sauce, Chocolate Shavings, Whipped Cream, and Graham Crumbs had this cooling effect. It's a great sweet summer treat. Thick cream. The Traditional Bread Pudding With Warm Caramel Pecan Sauce was soothing. Generous amount of pecans. It was a seal deal to a great meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the whole dining experience, this restaurant now tops as one of my favorite places in Vegas. I never had a burger impress me until today. Superb!!! Fantastic service, food, and ambiance. Lovelovelove this place :)\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Great service from the get go! The steak fish are delicious but please save room for emerils banana cream pie omg it's  the best.\n",
      "When in Vegas always make sure to eat at emerils restaurants.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Not worth the money.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place makes me wonder how Emeril is considered a great chef.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the salad to the steak, I remember everything here being too salty. \"Let's kick it up a notch\" my a$$. It seemed more like let's cover up the fact that I can't cook with tons of salt.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time I left the restaurant, I felt like my blood pressure must be sky high with all the salt I ingested. \n",

      "Needless to say, I won't be going back here again.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Our 1st time to Vegas and my husband loves Emeril, so we went with 3 other people.  Our waiter Ryan was just amazing!  Our food was divine!  We had such a good experience, when we go to Vegas we will definitely come here again.  I would recommend it to anyone!  Key Lime pie was so good!  We all liked the banana cream pie as well.  My Filet was to doe for.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Great experience. I enjoyed the filet and caesar salad! My steak was cooked to PERFECTION! The service was top notch! I will definitely return! One of my favorite steak houses in Las Vegas!!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My mom lives in Vegas so I am there all the time and we try a lot of the nicer restaurants in town.  Delmonico Steakhouse was one of the better ones.  We were a little early for our reservation so we sat in the bar and ordered a few drinks.  The hostess then called our name after only a couple of minutes so we did not get our drinks in the bar but they brought them to the table and added them to our bill.  It was a very smooth process.  For dinner, I had the fillet Mignon with blue cheese melted on it.  It was delicious.  The steak was a tad undercooked for my taste but I did order medium rare.  I guess I was expecting the norm where other restaurants cook medium rare closer to medium.  But overall the steak was delicious.  Good flavor and I loved the blue cheese.  My mom had the rack of lamb.  Again a little too undercooked for her taste but they truly cooked it to medium rare.  We shared the twice baked potatoes with cheese and bacon.  Yummy!  The bread was good too.  We had a great main waiter and his assistants.  Everyone treated us well and in a timely manner.  Definitely a place I will go again.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Delicious steak house! I will recommend you make reservations and come with a healthy appetite! This place is top notch. The decor is romantic and comfortable. I would definitely tell you truffle lovers to order the truffled potato chips. I promise they won't disappoint. In regards to the meat, it's comparable to any wonderful steakhouse I've ever been to. The service was phenomenal. This is a place I will definitely be returning to, it's a gem on the strip !\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] So you won some $$$$. make your reservation here, but come before 6pm on a Saturday night and see how it is to live like royalty in this dimly lit medival like castle within the Vencitian.   Two servers wait on you and actually share the foodie secrets you want to know.  Allergic to seafood and think steak is a food group for a husband or a meat lover, no problem, let the chefs here make you a special dish or sauce not on the menu that you will never forget.  The sturgeon was a designer version of catfish, and was very impressive.  By end of the 4th course, with a bonus freebie in the middle compliments of the chef, you have the Olympic urge to go for dessert.  Go for the gold.  Not to sweet, not too rich, just amazing - like everything in New Orleans, just like Emeril.   Chocolate treats here won't disappoint.  By 8pm, the place is packed, and the magic is nearly gone, so come early, esp. with a date, you won't be disappointed.\n",

      "I ordered the rib eye steak and we all shared to creamed spinach, the smashed potatoes and the sauteed garlic mushrooms.  They were all really good.  The steak was cooked perfectly (medium rare for me). Very tender! I wasn't a fan of the creamed spinach there but the potatoes and the mushrooms were fantastic!\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This was an amazing meal with wonderful service.  We ordered Filet Mignon and it was the best steak we ever had and we are from the Midwest.  Emeril knows his steak!  Husband started with the Lobster Bisque.  Best Bisque we have ever had.  Gratin potatoes were wonderful as an accompaniment for the steak!  Last we had the Emeril's Banana Cream Pie.  OMG!!!  This meal was worth every penny we spent on it.  It was incredible.  Delmonico's is a MUST DO in Las Vegas!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Impeccable service & the ambiance was right on. We had the cowboy ribeye and was top notch, the au gratin potatoes were recommended and was not let down and the mushrooms were OH SO GOOD! We were over stuffed but had to try the infamous banana cream pie.... AMAZING.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] All the years we've been staying at the Palazzo, and we finally make it to Delmonico! Sort of. For our personal experience, maybe 3.5 stars, but I'd go back, as I think some things were specific to our visit and I think the restaurant can do better. \n",

      "Jim G. and I stopped in at the bar for a spot of lunch. The bartender was often friendly, but sometimes seemed a bit confused or overwhelmed.  Turned out, he was new. Some of that is forgivable, but it wasn't busy at the bar, so some of it suggests that he's maybe not the best bartender in general.  Perhaps he was having an off day.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The cocktails were interesting and well-crafted but, in some cases (like the Bronte Sisters), the focus seemed so much on presentation that the actual drink part of the drink was missing. The full copper mug of crushed ice left me with a tiny, tiny drink for $16. The wine list is incredibly extensive and led me to a surprising error.  The way it's printed, it sometimes leads the eye to the wrong price, as the name of the wine and the price don't visually seem to be on the same line.  The wine we ordered was great, as I knew it would be, but it was not at the great price I thought it was. Nice surprise for us on the bill when it was 2.5x more! Technically, not their fault, but it feels like it wasn't an accident on their part. It was lunch; not like I already had been drinking!\n",
      "\n",
      "Onion soup was awesome! Get some, for real! Very dark roux, super flavorful cheese. We shared a steak which was not quite the size our bartender told us it would be (ounces aren't on the menu) but was prepared nicely. The steaks (all except Wagyu) are prepared cajun style, so expect a different flavor profile than your traditional steak. \n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] It was above average, not great. Went with my daughter and we both had the filet mignon, the steaks tasted great but were cooked inconsistently. The surprise hit was the appetizer - tuna carpaccio which was simply amazing and made the meal.\n",

We even got two tables of 10 next to each other! Excellent service! The food was good but did not stand out from most of the other vegas steakhouses or normal steakhouses in general. I would recommend just based on service we received.\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Emeril's Delmonico Steakhouse is located in the Venetian hotel, slightly across from the Blue Man Group Theatre. To be honest, I even liked Chef Emeril much. Never cared about his shows or his cooking. Guess he made me a believer after this one night dining at Delmonico. We made reservations through Open Table for a party of 12 on a Saturday night. We wanted 6:30pm but were only given the options of 5pm or 9pm (FYI, reservations were made about two weeks in advance). We weren't about to pig out then hit the night life scene all bloated and passing gas so we settled for 5pm which worked out anyways. Gave us plenty of time to digest and chill. \n",
      "\n",
      "We checked in with the three pretty hostesses and were offered to have a seat in their lounge area until our table was ready. Barely five minutes passed and our maître d' came out to fetch us. Unfortunately, he wasn't as easy on the eyes as the hostess. However, he took care of us the entire night. I apologize for not remembering his name because he's worth mentioning and deserve recognition: Caucasian, arrogant looking but very proper and attentive, and had a dark humor side to him. \n",
      "\n",
      "The establishment is quite simple but still very classy. It's dimly lit for you romantic types; unfortunately this was a bromance between 12 obnoxious dudes. The dining rooms and distance between tables were spacious enough so you're able to have some sort of privacy. You can tell that they didn't try to over do the interior design of the place. It's an elegant and clean look.\n",
      "\n",
      "We all decided to bypass appetizers and drinks and just went straight for the entrees and side dishes. We figured we'll be pounding enough booze later on the night. After recently having some awesome buffalo in Wyoming, I decided to order the Three Peppercorn Crusted American Buffalo Rib-eye with Caramelized Cipollini Onions and Brandy Peppercorn reduction ($50). For those of you who are already raising an eyebrow, this chunk of meat was by far gamey. It well cooked, very tender, and seemed to have less fat that then regular bone in rib eye. Personally, medium rare is the way to go. I sampled the bone in rib eye from my friend's plate and I have to say that the buffalo is the unanimous winner. A few of the other guys who are traditional beef carnivores decided to try the buffalo also agreed that the buffalo was well worth the try. Not to dock the rib eye because that was still very legit.\n",
      "\n",
      "For sides, we ordered two of the following to share: Sautéed Garlic Wild Mushrooms ($11), New Orleans Creamed Spinach ($9), and the Creamed Corn Gratinee ($11). It was the perfect amount of sides for the entire table, not over killing it yet a decent amount for each person. All sides were very delish and complimented our meals perfectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything could not have gone smoother. The 12 of us had a nice corner to ourselves. Service was top notch. Occasionally, they brought out 4-5 servers at once to present all the entrees to us all at the same time. Our drinks never ran dry and we were always checked up on every so often. The chef even sent out a sampling which was ground duck rice ball in a sweet and sour sauce. That could've easily been an appetizer order all together and we would've happily ordered it. Even the pricing was quite affordable considering the caliber of the steak house Delmonico is. I am quite impressed with what Chef Emeril has done with this restaurant. Big Props to him and the entire staff for an outstanding meal. I do look forward to future visits.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Located on Restaurant Row in the Venetian is Delmonico's Steakhouse. This place is nice, very nice. The lounge area was spacious, plentiful amount of seating, with a bar area. Not a bad place to hang out if there is a wait for your table. You are not able to see inside the restaurant from the lounge area. \n",
      "\n",
      "We had a table of 13 and we were separated into 2 tables. The seats were very very comfortable. I believe they do accommodate large parties all in one table, but I guess for that time slot on that day, this was our only choice. Reservations are highly recommended here and book in advance if you have a large party. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our waiter or host shall I call him was very informative about just about everything! He recommended what was the best things on the menu, where to party after dinner, what wines were great, along with how I should get my steak cooked! He was simply awesome. \n",
      "\n",
      "I order the BONE IN RIB STEAK which is also originally what the server recommended. The price for a good steak does not come cheap, this one was worth all $52.00. Medium rare was perfect. The steak is huge it almost took up the whole entire plate, tender, moist, juicy, perfect temperature, minimal fat, butter came on top of the steak like a pancake, very easy to cut, bone was just this big straight across:\n",

      "\n",
      "The sides are a bit deceiving if you look at the pictures of the sides. For some reason I was expecting a huge pot, but dont let the pictures fool you! The side order of sauteed mushrooms was very delicious. I put that to the side because I did not want to share with anyone. The truffle potato chips was very greasy, save your $10 and order another side instead. \n",
      "\n",
      "The calamari was okay. Not worth the $14. Marinara sauce came on top of the calamari already, so if you did not eat it fast enough, it could get soggy real quickly. \n",

      "What cost the restaurant a better rating was how we were greeted by the host staff.  While I was checking in, the hostess turned away to seat someone that just walked up as I was giving my name.  I was so surprised and offended that I was prepared to leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another host saw this and quickly jumped in and had us seated right away.  Kudos to him for the save, but still there was no apology issued.\n",

      "\n",
      "The ambiance and service were excellent. We started with the gumbo which was very bland and toned down from the original. The barbeque shrimp were ok, but nothing to write home about. For dessert, the banana creme pie was still excellent.\n",

My husband had the grilled chicken which was very good. Overall, it was okay. Nothing spectacular that made me want to return.\n",

We all got bone-in ribeyes medium rare (of course) with multiple sides and starters.  Unfortunately, mine came out clearly at medium well.  Which would be fine if I were not paying 50+ dollars to enjoy the wonderful dry-aged (etc., etc.) beef.  The steak still tasted good but not as great as it could have been.  I brought this to the attention of the waiter, who offered to bring me a new steak, but I did not wish to wait 15 minutes while my friends ate.  At the end of the meal, the waiter offered a free desert to make up for the steak, but we were all too full to enjoy one, so I declined.  No other offers were made to compensate for the overcooked steak (could have made any one of the drinks, appetizers or sides we ordered) and when the check arrived, the waiter had mistakenly added an extra bottle of wine to the tab (when brought to his attention, he removed it of course).  I know these are minor complaints, but having waited tables at much cheaper restaurants, I have found a way to make it up to a customer when mistakes were made.  I expect at least the same when a table is spending 400 dollars in your restaurant.  So all in all, the food was great, service good, but not up to par for the money you will spend.\n",

      "The food is top notch, I ordered the butternut squash ravioli (sans duck confit) and the wild arugula w/ raspberries.  Both dishes were just the right size (not too big, not too small), beautifully presented, perfectly seasoned and dressed, and absolutely delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered and shared the green apple crisp a la mode for dessert, I might have loved it more if I was still hungry, but I was so stuffed that I couldn't properly enjoy it.  Note to self: next time, dessert first!\n",

      "Must try items: Homemade potato chips with parmesan, truffle oil and scallions.  I was stuffing my face like no tomorrow and scraping the plate clean...The warm dinner rolls w/ butter...They smelled SO buttery!  Lastly, the corn gratin, the panko topping was so crispy, it was unreal, the gratin underneath was hot, steamy, and sweet from the crisp fresh corn.  SOOO GOOOD!\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, this place was expensive, but none of the staff had to overdo it to impress us, the atmosphere, food and service spoke for itself, so it was worth every penny.\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] If I had to choose between Delmonico or Carnevino Ribeye, the choice is simple. Delmonico. Two amazing restaurants, two different styles, but personal preference would land me at Delmonico.\n",
      "\n",
      "W-O-W. Flavorful steak, HUGE portions, it was really, really hard to hide my semi while I was tearing into the meat. Great side dishes like garlic mushrooms, amazing peach cobbler for dessert, great red wine, attentive wait staff... pure bliss. Better than wearing my clown suit at an elementary school. Way better. Well... no, that's a bold statement. But it's friggin close.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Delmonico, the trivia first. \n",
      "Delmonico doesn't have Emeril Lagasse's name on it, however it is his establishment. Word is he signed a contract with MGM properties so no other place on the strip can use his name outside of the MGM properties. The only mention you will see is his first name mentioned in the dessert selection, other than that nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The atmosphere is nice and the waiter service is killer. However the food was lacking, the steak although cooked to perfection lacked some flavor and they do not mention how large the steaks are. Thepetit filet mignon was tiny, six ounces for sixty dollars which included three overcooked shrimp lobster topped. \n",

      "The frog legs were good, a different for once and their selection of fine drinks is a good selection.\n",

      "\n",
      "Love the fact that this place has maintained such great quality over the years.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Not impressed, and having the server laugh at me while telling me there was no refills for the bar glass sodas didn't help, maybe they've changed that policy since, but I don't care, although the food was decent ( I've had better creole shrimp and better steaks) I feel like they should have at least given me some vaseline with that screwing, I mean come on $27 for soda?\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] As part of a birthday celebration weekend for two of my cousins, a group of us decided to head to Delmonico Steakhouse for a really nice birthday dinner. We had no idea what to expect of this place, except for the high prices. \n",
      "\n",
      "We were running late for our reservation, but we called the restaurant letting them know we were on our way. It was a group of 6, so we really did not want to loose our reservation. They could not have been any more helpful over the phone! Directions were provided, and they kindly held our table until we arrived.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon arrival, we were quickly escorted to our table. Our server kindly welcomed us and wished my two cousins a very happy birthday and memorable meal. After we all ordered our entrees, we were pleasantly surprised with complimentary appetizers for the entire group (halibut ceviche which was to die for!!). Their bread rolls were extremely delicious and always kept coming. Water was always replenished without even asking. Always a step ahead those people! When it came time to receiving our entrees, the wait staff made sure that all our orders were correct before setting them on the table. The dinner was then completed with complimentary sorbet (made in house). Everything was delicious!!! No one had any complaints about anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was excellent; above and beyond my expectations of any restaurant. I have been to other restaurants like Delmonico's at The Venetian for birthday celebrations, and none match the superb service and attention of Delmonico. Despite the fact that the restaurant's prices are high, the overall experience, taste of the food, and service make it an exceptional place for any occasion.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My favorite storehouse. Better than Cut better than Maestros better than Ruths Chris. Just can't be beat. Went here again for the kazillionth time this weekend. I always go when in Vegas. So good so good. Never a complaint.\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I really enjoyed the overall experience!  The bone in filet with foie gras was really amazing.  The drinks were wonderful and they have a very nice wine selection.  The service was 'jonnie on the spot' with all levels of servers keeping a watchful eye on the table...perhaps too watchful!  Twice, as I looked around to check out the décor and the people, they came running over to assist.  Better to have false alarms then left waiting.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the place has one issue, it's the atmosphere.  The design is plain white arched ceilings with rock wall and white light accents.  I respect how much they were able to achieve with just architecture and lights, but without the lights it might look a bit like a medieval dungeon.  \n",
      "\n",
      "All things considered, the food and service were about as good as it gets so go check it out!\n",

      "\n",
      "Wow, what a treat. I went there as just one person and was seated in a booth by myself and was still given excellent service and attention as I would expect. I was expertly consulted by a sommelier on my wine choices to go with my $50 filet that was cooked to a perfect medium rare. All in all I had a $120 five course meal with two glasses of wine. Some may think outrageous, but hey its Vegas and I didn't have a problem splurging a little bit. Enjoy yourself - this is 5 star perfection for service.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I have eaten at this restaurant twice. The first meal was memorable and I never forgot it. As a result, I was so excited to go back last week. I had the truffle chips for an appetizer which were good but they didn't fit in with that kind of restaurant. My friend had a shrimp appetizer that was the favorite of the waiter's but we both found it very strange. It was supposed to be something creole and the shrimp was covered with an unattractive brown sauce. Odd.\n",
      "\n",
      "We both had a filet mignon. I ordered mine medium rare. I couldn't finish the last 15% of it because it was rare. Disgusting. It was fine but not worth $50. It came with a  sauce that made it delicious though. Without the sauce it would have been a big disappointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered a side of double baked potatoes. That was the best part of the meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "We each ordered a dessert. I had the banana cream pie. It was gorgeous but it was all bananas (which I LOVE) but with little cream. It was fine. My friend had the creme brulee and it was delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service was very nice. Overall at $312 I won't be going back simply because it isn't worth the money.\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I took my best friend to Delmonico Las Vegas last Saturday, January 14, 2017 for her Birthday dinner.  I was very disappointed, the Fried Oyster appetizer dish was cold at the inside, the Creole Shrimps was also cold where these 2 dishes was suppose to be hot.  The Bone-in-Rib eye was fatty and the Pork Chop tasted like Barbecue Pork.  The meal was expensive and I don't mind paying for an expensive meal but it was not worth the money.  \n",
      "Greatly disappointed in the food, the service was wonderful but not the food.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Great food, ambience and staff. The mash potatoes are possibly the best I've ever had! Def try the caramel butter cake with the little mint leaves...delish.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My visit to Delmonico Steakhouse was in August for our annual Wedding Anniversary trip.  A few days ago, we received a postcard from Delmonico Steakhouse - from our waiter Michael Jackson :o)\n",
      "What a nice surprise!!  It was just a short note to say thank you for visiting their establishment and hope to see us soon.  \n",

      "A little late - But here's my review....\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me start off by saying.. I wasn't too sure about visiting Delmonico Steakhouse since there are sooooo many restaurants that I want to try every time I go to Vegas.  I think we've been to almost ALL the Steak houses in Vegas.  CUT and CRAFT.. some of our favorites.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon arrival.. we were seated within 3 minutes - which is a GREAT start.  People that know me are well aware that I do not like waiting.  \n",
      "We were directed to a nice booth area and my husband and I were able to sit by each other to \"people watch\". \n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately we were welcomed by our waiter, Michael Jackson.  We started off with 2 glasses of Chardonnay - Light and smooth. \n",
      "Since I wanted to try so many of the sides and apps.. I decided that I'd just share the steak with my husband..  \n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I went here for my friend's bachelor party's dinner.  I am not a steak person but after reading all the reviews here about the bone in rib eye and then hearing the waiter's description I was in for one.  I ordered it Medium Well.  When it came to the table I was expecting it to be tough, chewy, small, etc... When it arrived at the table it was a pretty big slab of meat and  when I cut into it and had my first slice it was totally opposite of what I was expecting.  It was soft, flavorful, and melted in your mouth.  I should have expected that instead since it was priced $52.  Best damn cooked to order piece of steak I have ever had to this day =)\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] If you want a perfectly executed, consistent steak, this place is where you go.  Everything is the gold standard.   I had a medium rare ribeye that was wonderful.  Sides were great and the bread.... so good that you can just eat the bread alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "My biggest issue, it's boring.  Really boring.  If you've had an expense account like me due to work, you eat at these places every month and although it's great, it gets boring.   Same type of people, same type of customers, dressed the same way.     I know... first world problems.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] After a quick drink at Public House, I was feeling pretty good, and hungry, and a little buzzed. Here's how my conversation with our waiter began:\n",
      "\n",
      "Me: \"What kind of bread is this?\"\n",
      "Waiter: \"They're popovers sir.\"\n",
      "Me: \"Has anyone ever commented that they're shaped like dicks?\" \n",
      "Waiter: \"Haha, no sir, very good observation sir.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Yup, their popovers were pretty much shaped like dicks. They were a bit cold, oily, and combined with the refrigerated butter (one of my pet peeves at restaurants), a big disappointment. Despite the phallic start to dinner, the rest of the meal and service was excellent. \n",
      "\n",
      "The recommended lobster bisque was a great way to cleanse my palate of that bread. There were big chunks of lobster meat and the bisque was well-seasoned without going overboard with the salt. Delmonico is known for their bone-in ribeye so I ordered that medium-rare. The steak was more on the medium side, but no complaints here as it was just as juicy and tender. No steak is complete without a side of creamed spinach, which was done well. All sides are portioned to be shared. Despite a misstep with my friend's order (bone-in NY strip instead of boneless), service was spot on.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I was (again) lucky enough to have lunch here to participate in an IT seminar for my place of employment.  When has a free steak ever turned me down?\n",
      "\n",
      "Delmonico was no exception, good food!  I had wanted to try this place before but eating like a king on a pauper's salary just didn't cut it.  Emeril has done a great job with his steakhouse here in Las Vegas.\n",
      "\n",
      "The presenters for this IT seminar were smart, they decided to make us go though a big chunk of their product presentation BEFORE letting us start to partake in our steak lunch.  That was smooth guys...make us sweat it out!  But the payoff was pretty good.  Our menu was one created by the folks doing the seminar, it was a nice three-course meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "We started off with Delmonico's Organic Baby Mixed Greens Salad - topped with creole spiced croutons, shaved manchego cheese, teardrop tomatoes, shaved red onions, and a sherry vinaigrette.  Excellent salad, light, tart, salty, and the croutons and red onions (I love them raw if they're sliced really thin) gave it some nice crunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next we had the choice of either a steak or salmon.  Seeing as I was in a steakhouse and that I-like-a-the-beef, I naturally went for a steak.  On the menu was a petite ribeye - which was charbroiled USDA prime aged, creole seasoned, and topped with butter.  Got mine in a nice medium rare.  Boy oh boy, was this a winner!  Tender, succulent, cooked right, a nice kick from the creole seasoning, excellent I say.  I usually like a steak sauce with my steak...but alas, I did not need it!  I sopped up every last bit of the beefy goodness.  The side of Country Smashed Potatoes were good too, but you can guarantee I kept my focus on that lil' slice of heavenly ribeye!  It's up there with one of the most tastiest steaks I've had, and this was only a mini-me of the full size!  I took a look at some of the other diners steaks that weren't in on our seminar, and they were huge!  Delmonico definitely puts out a lot of meat for the money.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ended the menu with a chocolate tart of some sort, I cannot fully remember it off the top of my head because I really wasted most of my brain power consuming that steak.  But yes, that tart must have been pretty good because I do remember finishing that as well!\n",
      "\n",
      "Quickly looking at the actual menu, Delmonico is on par with pricing as other steakhouses in the area.  Most steaks are hitting the $40-50 range, sides are around $9 a pop, with desserts around $10.  Not cheap so if you're going here make sure it's a special occasion!  But then again, if you are rich I guess everyday would be a special occasion.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] i ate here on 10-27-14 around 5:30 pm.  i enjoyed my dining experience in the bar.  the hostess staff was very friendly.  the bar staff did a great job too.  they took the time to go over the menu and to have some small talk.  made the dining experience more enjoyable.\n",
      "\n",
      "for dinner i ordered the bone in ribeye.  i really enjoyed this steak more than \"the cut\" which was in the palazzo.  my delmonico ribeye had more flavor and juices!  i enjoyed my free bread basket too.  the side of smashed potatoes were great!  i went with the bar servers recommendation of trying the banana cream pie.  not my cup of tea but i enjoyed my pie.\n",
      "\n",
      "i enjoyed my steak, the staff and overall had a great time.  my bill before tip was $86.  i would definitely go back again!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Lobster bisque, spinach salad and wild mushrooms.  Yum, yum and yum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ribeye.  Large portion perfectly med rare, but too \"saucy\" (not sure why they feel butter is necessary on such a flavorful cut that should be able to stand on its own.)  Truthfully, I've had better ribeye on our backyard grill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lamb.  Overcooked and also too saucy.  Not sure what that flavorless choux puff was about...\n",
      "\n",
      "Took two bottles of wine, but only got charged 1 corkage.  Nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I ever go back - which I doubt I will - I'll stick to the non meat items.  Guess for a steak house that's not high praise....\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I have to admit, I didn't try the steak there.  Based on everyone else in my group who was eating, they loved it though.  I ate semi light for my dinner: a crab bisque soup, spinach salad, and a baked potato.  All of it was very very good.  Being that said, that still cost me $35 easy. There really is no cheap thing to eat here, other then the sides that went for $9 a pop.  The atmosphere is pretty relaxed.  The service is good.  They paid attention to the little things that mattered like re-filling up your water when your cup is empty, and coming back every 10 minutes or so to ask if you need anything else.  Be prepared to bring a chunk of change with ya...steaks costs anywhere from $50 to $60 depending on how you want it prepped or what kind of steak you want.  I would try this place again, and see if the steak is really that damn good.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Make sure you get reservations, this place was PACKED. \n",
      "\n",
      "Service level is great, which is one of the reasons I'm sure it was so highly rated.\n",
      "\n",
      "I only had some fabulous red wine and the filet, so I can't attest for anything else but everyone in my party enjoyed our meal.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Three words. De-lic-ious. Ribeye. Yes Please. Great wait staff.  Oysters to start, wedge salad. 'nough said. If Emeril Lagasse put's his name on it...well chances are you'll enjoy it.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Ate there back in April.  Man what a great place. My friend and I had the NY Strip with the twice bake potato and caesar salad was good.  Plan on trying a steak house over at Caesars Palache's in January but may be heading back to Delmonicos as well.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Had dinner here last week - great food, very nice atmosphere.  Top notch steakhouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bone in ribeye was delicious, as you would expect there was a lot of fat on it but the flavor was worth it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The bone in filet (a special) was very good, tender, less fat than the rib eye but also less flavor.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I would say both are worth getting but it depends on your preference for flavor vs. tenderness.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The duck was very good - not fatty as most duck is but still full of flavor - if you are looking for a non steak entre I think this is the way to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't have one so I cannot confirm but someone I was dining with said the mojito was the best they have ever had so keep that in mind if you are a mojito fan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall a great dinner.\n",

      "\n",
      "Whether you spell it \"whiskey\" or \"whisky\", Carol W and I have been long time lovers of this brown spirit in all of its forms.  Therefore, it was a logical imperative that we check out Delmonico Steakhouse and its vaunted whiskey collection.  We got there around 9:30 on a Thursday night and the place was largely empty as the restaurant was nearing the end of its service for the night.  As a side mission, we wanted to also check out the much-mentioned \"secret\" menu of whiskey-based cocktails created and crafted by Delmonico's lead barman, Max Solano.  Max possesses encyclopedic knowledge of whiskey and is personable and passionate about what he does and if he isn't busy, is very willing to impart some of his knowledge discussing the finer points of whiskey and his whiskey program.  As the curator of Delmonico's whiskey collection, he's assembled the most comprehensive lineup of whiskeys I've ever seen to include hundreds of ultra high quality, hard to find, or never heard of before brands from around the world.  As a personal aside, did they have Pappy Van Winkle?  Yes, of course,...the ENTIRE frickin' Pappy product line and it was on the shelf, not out of stock like so many other places that have it listed on their menu!  I was so tempted to get the Pappy whiskey flight, but on this visit, I was even more intrigued by the secret menu of cocktails.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Delmonico has a standard (but very intriguing looking) cocktail menu consisting of classics and originals that all of the bartenders can prepare.  However, only Max knows how to craft the secret menu cocktails.  I had the Don's Orders made with Templeton Rye and the Smoked Bluff made with Glenmorangie 12 yr. and both were complex, boozy with subtle sweetness, yet completely balanced.  Simply put, Max's secret menu cocktails were hands down the best treatment of whiskey in a cocktail form that I've yet consumed.  If you love whiskey, then the Delmonico Steakhouse is a must!  The next time for us?  We may even get around to trying the food!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Note to Vegas douchebags (all of you): when you are planning a dinner at a well known restaurant that's oozing stars and dollar signs, Ed Hardy is not considered dressing up. This is my splurge dinner on this vacation. I'm writing this at the table - key tones off of course, keeping it classy. I had a reservation for 9:00, got there 5 minutes early, and waited 25 minutes. Not unheard of, but neither is an apology or a \"thank you for waiting.\" I also felt a little ignored as a single diner not ordering alcohol. My soda glass sat empty for a long time before I was asked if I wanted another. This happened twice, once between appetizer and main course, and once when i had a third of my steak left. No mention of whether I would be charged for refills, but either way that will be factored into the tip.  Either assume that I would like it refilled and don't let it hit the table empty, or show some sort of bottle or other indication that I'll be seeing $4-5 each on the bill. I also didn't appreciate the lonely roll that was deposited on my table. Just because I'm by myself doesn't mean I don't want a little basket of warm rolls to scarf down at my leisure. I was asked if I wanted another after I was done, and I declined. It was also brought out at the end of the appetizer, which indicated to me that it had been initially forgotten.  My appetizer was completely delicious. I am sad to inform you that it was a special and may not be there when you dine. It was lump crab and gnocchi. Pesto, brown butter, lemon. The crab tasted like Dungeness, the best of course. The gnocchi was toasty and so delicate that I could have eaten it with a spoon like ice cream.  Next came the rib eye, medium, and creamed corn gratinee. The corn was good. The topping was crispy. The steak was definitely closer to medium well than medium. I expect a $50 steak to be flavorful and cut like butter. There were bites that I felt I was choking down. I also found it to be underseasoned. When I asked for sauces, I was given three options. Bearnaise, Emeril style A-1, and something muttered of which I only heard worcestershire. I think it might have been just that. I opted for the E-1. It didn't solve the seasoning issue and I found the taste odd.  The verdict is in on the diet coke. It was three dollars and I was not charged for refills. Why keep asking then?  I don't see how that could be considered elevated service. I had a much better meal and experience last year at SW at the Wynn. I will not be back to Delmonico.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The service was great. The appetizer bread was stale. The lunchtime burger was good but definitely overpriced, much better burgers at umami burger. The lobster sliders were decent.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My boss reccomended Delmonico's to me in a SERIOUS way, so when I had a chance to go to Vegas with some big foodies, I immediately suggested we try it out. We made reservations for 10:00pm on the Friday we were all scheduled to arrive. We were all coming seperately from different airlines and different cities and planned to meet at the airport and head out. I. WAS. PUMPED. Super damn excited. \n",
      "\n",
      "And then my flight was delayed. I hate Southwest-- this is what happens when you try to be cheap but still end up paying $250 to fly for half an hour from LA to Vegas. My flight was delayed and delayed and I started to really worry. I worried in the terminal while I nervously sipped my venti coffee. (I swear I had ordered a tall?) I worried for the TWO HOURS I spent sitting on the plane on the runway, trying with much difficulty to bury my face in Harry Potter 7 while I sat next to a really annoying and \"overly affectionate\" couple. (Seriously... DON'T DO THAT. WTF!? Have you no decency!?! Where the fuck is your mother!??!)\n",
      "\n",
      "I landed at 10:00, booked it to the cab line, sprinted through the Venetian in heels, and, sweaty, restless, tired, and uncomfortable with my carry-on bag, met my friends at the bar in Delmonico's at 10:20. My entire excursion from my house in Los Angeles to the restaurant in Vegas took 4 hours. I'm pretty sure I could have driven. I wanted to die.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was it worth it?\n",
      "YES IT WAS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grey Goose and tonic: strong enough to keep me from death type of worth it.\n",
      "Beer and cheese fondue with pretzel bread: salty-cheesy goodness type of worth it.\n",
      "Oysters Rockefeller: I don't even like oysters and it was worth it.\n",
      "Truffle parmesan potato chips: the light, crispy, addicting type of worth it.\n",
      "Salad with fresh fried mozzarella: I want to eat this cheese until I gain 400 pounds and have to be air-lifted out of my house type of worth it.\n",
      "Dry Grilled Aged Sirlion a la Oscar with Blue Crab: I was so full at this point I could only eat two bites of this and it was STILL worth it.\n",
      "Three different attentive waiters: I get a little chill when waiters murmur \"Pardon my reach\" under their breath like it's a secret type of worth it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The menu looked expensive (around $50 for entrees) but our table, for 4 people with a half bottle of wine, cocktails, entrees for each, soups/slads, and appetizers came out to around $400. It was pretty reasonable for the volume and quality of food we ate, but, really now, $400 is spendy. I won a little bit of money over the weekend, so now I can afford to go back. And I will be back!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Service was exceptional here! They start off with croissant type rolls which were nice and light, followed with a small tea cup of tomato bisque, and then served your choice of a soup or salad. I ordered the lobster bisque which was exquisite, but someone else got the parmesan potato soup which they said was also exceptional. Most of our party got the filet, and everyone loved it. Lastly for dessert, I had a key lime pie all to myself and I almost ordered a second. Not too rich or heavy, and went perfect with a post-dinner coffee. Highly recommend, but very expensive.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This is has been on my list for a while, so it was one of my first choices for Spring Restaurant Week this year. I came here for lunch during the week with fellow Yelpers and we took advantage of their $30.14 prie fixe menu (Three Square $4 donation). I also utilized Open Table to make my reservation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three of us started with the Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad for our appetizer. The fresh heirloom tomatoes (2-3 different types/colors) were served with a dollop of creamy Burrata cheese, red onion, extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and fresh local basil. Really crisp and refreshing; great start to our meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the entrée, I selected the Delmonico's Prime Hamburger served on a toasted brioche roll with cheddar cheese, crispy bacon, and the usual fixings (lettuce, tomato, onion). It was perfectly medium rare with juices oozing out with every squeeze. The burger had great flavor and seasoning, so that made it stand out from other burgers I've had. It was also an extremely generous portion. I could barely finish half of it (and I eat A LOT). My only complaint was that although the burger started out juicy and delicious, it dried out really quickly and made it almost difficult to eat. I'm not sure what attributed to this, but it was odd. The fries were delicious! A unique preparation of crispiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also had the opportunity to taste the Butternut Squash Ravioli prepared with sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts, and parmesan cheese and Pan Roasted Atlantic Salmon served with a sweet corn and crab vinaigrette and fresh basil. Both were really delicious! The salmon was so soft with a succulent rareness in the center of the filet. I was also really impressed with the large chunks of crab meat and whole kernels of corn.\n",
      "\n",
      "For dessert, I opted for the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Bread Pudding with Vanilla Bean Crème Anglaise. I'm glad someone else chose Emeril's Banana Cream Pie because it was a tough decision for me (both being my favorite desserts). The bread pudding was moist, warm, and very yummy. The pecan caramel-like sauce was a bit sweet, but fortunately, the pudding was not. The banana cream pie was topped with caramel sauce, chocolate shavings, and whipped cream. Yum. It was good, but I'll have to order one in the future to get a really good taste of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant is nice and I like the dimly lit rooms with spotlights on each table. It wasn't very busy during our meal, but I'm sure it would still be that nice and quiet. The service was also phenomenal. I was extremely pleased with the offering of Harney & Sons tea (transported in the most gorgeous wooden box display) and the fact that it was complimentary. Everyone was so prompt to refill my pot with hot water and of course, it was served with fresh lemon and honey. We also stayed past their lunch service and they were so kind to allow us to loiter for that long.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] To be honest it really quit aweful. First the host was uninviting. Sure not rude however I felt like I just walked into Denny's at 2:30 am for some pancakes. The wait staff was prompt however I would have rather been served by Denny's. They not nice and unattentive. They made us feel like it was best if we just hurried finished our meal. Of course we occommidated them becuase once started eating the food was certainly good quality but way over salted. It was very pasty. Odds are unless someone else insists I wont be visting again. Why when there are so many other great choices. One more thing. The restaurant really had no theme.  White walls coupled with the staff it felt like an expensive hospital cafeteria.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Good food, but not what I expected from an Emeril restaurant.  I've been to his restaurants in Miami and New Orleans, and those were both 5-star experiences; however, the food at Delmonico was not as good as my previous experiences.  It was good, just not 5-star good.  I had the rib-eye, which was perfectly cooked.  But the grits left A LOT to be desired, which was disappointing considering that grits is a staple of southern cooking.  The service was good, although the main server seemed a bit distracted at times.  At that price point, my experience is that servers are almost falling all over you.  With all of the wonderful choices of restaurants in Vegas, I think I'll try somewhere different next time.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] At least 4.5 stars. Let me start by staying that I thought this was a great place. The ambiance was fantastic and maybe I enjoyed myself so much because we went here with a group of 18 or so right after my husband and I got married in the Venetian but here's the breakdown. \n",
      "\n",
      "The appitizers were really great, the parmesan chips were thin and had wonderful flavor. We talked about stealing a basket as we left. The bbq shrimp was done perfectly and a great twist. \n",
      "\n",
      "My brother had the soft shell crab and that may have been my favorite thing I had. It was fantastic but I don't have much comparison since that was actually the first time I've had soft shell crab. Nevertheless, it had great flavor and I would order it again. My husband and I split a steak and got the cesear salad. The salad was really nice and fresh. The steak was great, and probably in the top 3 I have ever had. \n",
      "\n",
      "We had a bunch of wine and tried a few different kinds and they were all great. The manager came over and talked to us about the wines and was very informative and nice. \n",
      "\n",
      "The reason why this didn't get 5 stars from me was because for the price, you just expect a little more from the steaks. This was still one of the best dinners I have ever had and I would absolutely go back.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I feel like Twitter is pretty useless so far; I have an ok amount of followers I guess, but I feel like they're all following so many people that anything I say gets lost in the mess of their feed. I could tweet all day and get very little response to anything aside from a couple loyal folks on there. And it was one such reader that led me to Delmonico recently for what he claimed to be an excellent burger. He's a food writer in town so he should know what he's talking about, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Delmonico is located in the small restaurant row of the Venetian right by another great burger spot, although most people would not come here for their burger. The interior is nothing too fancy in either the bar area or more traditional area in the back. I did notice while sitting at the bar that they have an amazing bourbon selection, but since I was there during a lunch break I'll have to go back some time when I'm not on the clock. The lunch and dinner menus are a bit different, with the lunch menu featuring more sandwiches and things, so maybe the comment I just made about people not coming for a burger is wrong. Either way, this restaurant is pretty fancy and features quite a number of great sounding items aside from what I came there for.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Delmonico Prime Hamburger comes on a toasted brioche roll with fries, cheddar cheese and bacon. The meat had excellent flavor from the first bite, but I noticed right away that it was way overcooked and dry. It started off extremely juicy but that faded way too fast and by the end it was very dry. The cheese was melted and had great flavor, but the bun was a tiny bit dry as well and a little too thick. The heirloom tomatoes were fantastic, but maybe a bit off-putting at first due to their green color. The bacon also had good flavor, but was a tiny bit undercooked and soggy in parts. Overall it was still decent, but could have been well beyond that if the meat had been cooked properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luckily the fries were great. Some of them were almost a bit too hard and crunchy, but they were very tasty and a welcome change to the 'typical' fries I often get around town. Something I found to be quite funny was when I asked for ketchup I was brought an insanely large bowl of it, more than probably a table full of people could have used.\n",
      "\n",
      "The online menu lists the burger at $15, so I was a little surprised to see the $18 listed on the menu when I made my order. I think if it was cooked properly I would still be ok with this price given the chef, the location, etc, but because of this price I seriously frown on the fact that they couldn't cook my burger properly. If you're willing to risk this inconsistency and are ok with the cost, I think it's a good burger to check out, and has the potential to be really great, but if you're at the Venetian and are craving a guaranteed good burger for a similar cost I suggest you go next door.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] There's a reason why Emeril Lagasse is such a celebrated chef. His restaurant, Delmonico Steakhouse, provided impeccable service and outstanding food.\n",
      "\n",
      "Delmonico Steakhouse was our big dinner out in Vegas for a bachelorette weekend. 9 of us were promptly seated for our 7:30pm Sunday reservation. I ordered a glass of malbec (my favorite, which is rather had to find).\n",
      "\n",
      "As a table, we shared the BBQ shrimp (which was just the right hit of smokey and sweet), Truffle and Parm Potato Chips (uberly addictive) and the lettuce wedge salad.\n",
      "\n",
      "For my entrée, I decided to get the Bone In Ribeye-the house specialty. It did not disappoint. It was quite a large piece of steak, but it didn't stop me from finishing all of it (that's not something I do very often). We split the creamed spinach and the creamed corn gratinee. The spinach was average but the creamed corn was vegetable candy. \n",
      "\n",
      "We ended our meal with Emeril's infamous Banana Cream Pie. Holy moly. Sky high pie packed with bananas, caramel sauce, chocolate shavings, and whipped cream. Even though we were all full, we couldn't help but finish it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our waiter was extremely attentive. Service, overall, was phenomenal. When our steaks were ready, there was a server for each plate so we were presented our dishes at the same exact moment. Now that's service.\n",
      "\n",
      "It goes without saying that this was pricey, even for Vegas standards, but you get what you pay for. \n",

      "For the price, the spinach should have been fresh and the cream sauce needs improvement. \n",
      "My organic filet was good and nicely cooked to medium rare, however not near as tasty as other organic beef I have had for half the price.\n",
      "The New Orleans gumbo was a tad too salty.  The yorkshire style buns were average and were cold.  \n",
      "The key lime pie was average.  The tartness was lacking.  The apple pie was a disappointment, with a doughy flavoured crust.\n",
      "Another thing that  high end restaurants need to learn is how to choose great coffees like good wines.  I asked where the beans were from and they had no idea.  I would expect excellence in all areas of my food consumption and yes, even with my coffee. The espresso was extremely poor.\n",
      "This is a restaurant that is way overpriced for average to good tasting food.  Nothing was outstanding or excellent.\n",
      "So I can only give it a rating of 2 combining value and flavour.\n",

      "\n",
      "My friends and I came here for dinner on a Sunday (with a reservation, just in case), and we decided to split two steaks between 3 girls. We ehard that the portions are very generous, and we also wanted to try out the sides as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered the bone in ribeye, along with the bone in filet mignon with a mushroom sauce (one of the specials of the day).  We also ordered the truffle parmesan potato chips, as well as the creamed corn gratinee and the country smashed potatoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing to come out were the potato chips. Sadly, for a girl who eats potato chips as her main meal frequently, I couldn't partake of them because of the parmesan (I cannot stand stinky cheese).  However, I did at least try ONE, and the texture of the chip (similar to a kettle chip almost), and the slight hint of truffle was amazing. However, the parmesan was still prominent, so I watched sadly while my gfs devoured the chips. I felt as if I was being punished, for some reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luckily our steaks arrived at that point, and they were HUGE. It was definitely a good idea that we had decided to split two instead of each of us ordering our own.  Our server (who's name I forgot), was incredibly helpful and nice. He brought over a carving table and after presenting the steaks to us, took them aside and carved them all for us.  We got our sides at that point too, and we just dug in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rib eye was incredibly flavorful. I tend to not normally order it because not all places will grill the ribeye properly and I end up with a slightly tough steak (even if ordered at medium). This one had just the right amount or pink, and the seasoning was mild enough so that the flavor of the meat shone through.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The filet was also very tender.  While we were eating the filet without the mushroom demiglace, I decided to test it out.  The sauce is based on a reduction of veal stock, and it complimented the steak wonderfully. It didn't mask the taste of the meat at all but just added another dimension to it.  After urging my friends to try the sauce, we quickly started pouring spoonfuls of it over the rest of the steak on our plates.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sides were very good as well. The creamed corn had a hint of spice due to some mined jalapenos that were in it. Definitely a trick I am looking forward to trying at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "As great as the food was, I was also very impressed with the level of service. You would think that a fancy steak restaurant would be annoyed at the sharing of steaks, but they never batted an eye to our request (apparently a lot of people do this).  In addition, we never felt as if we were waiting to flag down a server whenever we needed assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "For everything we got, the meal itself also came out to be a lot less than I expected (although I'm sure it has to do with the sharing as well). However, we were so full and satisfied from our meal that we promptly fell asleep back in our room and decided against going out that night. That is definitely a sign of a great meal.\n",

      "\n",
      "Thumbs up:\n",
      "They did recognize our anniversary and gave us a complimentary dish before our salad came out.  I forgot what it was, but it consisted of a chip of some sort, with a slice of beef on top.  It tasted it like it had ginger, soy, and some more stuff and also sesame seeds.  It was really good!  I wish we had more or could have swapped it out with the calamari.\n",

Unbelievable meal . Steaks were all excellent , sides (family style) delicious and the seafood tower app was fresh and  adequate for the 5 of us eating seafood . One friend had the lamb chops and was very satisfied. The service was by far the best part , in all honesty . Frank and his assistants were all on point . Strongly recommend for a high end meal, especially if staying at Venetian or The Palazzo .\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We were very disappointed with Delmonicos steakhouse. I ordered my steak medium to medium rare and it was overcooked and burnt on the outside.  My fiancé's steak was also sub par. Our sides came out cold.  Dessert was just ok. The worst part was the bathroom- it was filthy and I was disgusted (garbage had overflowed all over the floor).  Definitely not worth the $300+ we paid.  We will not return.\n",

It was huge, beautifully cooked, and tasted good. It was missing one thing for me: SALT! My impression was that it had none. My BF said he liked it as it was. Don't get me wrong, it was a really good steak but it left me wanting more from the flavor spectrum. The potatoes were okay.\n",

Secondly, their Pan Seared Foie Gras literally took my breath away because I was enjoying it so much I damn near forgot to breath.  That is saying a lot because normally I don't like liver!

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Steak and sides were tasty although not nearly as well prepared or delicious as the food at Ruth's Chris. The pecan pie desert was actually the best part of the meal and the chicory coffee was horrible. Wine list offered $40.00 bottles of wine for over $100.00. Service was excellent which it should be when your paying so much money for your food. Ruth's Chris is much better steak and sides for less money. A fun experience but will not be back for a long time.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Surprisingly very mediocre, considering I had heard such fantastic things.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many things that could be talked about, but at a steakhouse like this everything should be coming back to the hunk of dry-aged beef in front of your face. It should be flavorful, seared to just a tad crisp on the outside, and it should be consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "My steak was almost reasonable. My buddy's steak next to me (same cut) was left half-finished on the plate (overcooked and just generally not awesome).\n",
      "\n",
      "The ambience and service was great, but if you can't get the steak right...\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] You're in Vegas what else do you expect but excellent cuisine from a world famous Emeril restaurant? Yes this place is on the pricier side, yes the portions are huge, and yes its an upscale place. But you pay to play in Vegas so that is exactly what you receive here. The service was nothing but superb! It didn't matter if you're a big wig celeb, or just a family for wkend trip they treated every patron with the exact same excellent service. \n",
      "\n",
      "The menu is pretty much full of steaks or some selections of pasta and seafood. Pretty much all items are ordered Al a carte in addition to your entree selection. The majority of us had the highly recommended bone in rib eye. OMG you will know with your first bite why this aged piece of steak is $52! It literally melts like butter in your mouth! The seasoning was spot on with that perfect caramelized crust. I would definitely recommend the rib eye if this is your first time here! \n",
      "\n",
      "The must have side dish is the Creamed Corn Gratinee: This has the consistency of cream of corn yet has the crusty top of your usual gratins. It's has a delicious sweet yet savory flavor profile that just makes you wanna come back for seconds. The only negative is its $11 for that little dish. But again you pay for the quality instead of quantity here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next must have dessert is the banana cream pie! It's quite literally 8 layers of banana slices staked high! This reminds you exactly of what a banana cream pie your grandma used to make at home tastes!  This is quite the perfect way to finish off your meal or share with a date/friends. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will definitely be visiting again on your next Vegas trip. But yes you'll need to save up for this one as your wallet may cry once you see the bill!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I have eaten her a few times and every time have had the best service, food, wine and desert. \n",

      "They really know how to cook a steak and make you feel welcome. I look forward to my next trip to Vegas and my dinner at Delmonico's. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's a must try.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I've been to this location twice over the years.  This is located in Palazzo in the walkway towards the venetian.  Both times i ordered the bone-in rib eye, and both times it was pretty good.  This latest time i ordered Medium-Rare, but it was definitely more on the medium side.  I should have been more upset it wasn't cooked exactly how i wanted it, but it was still good.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For dessert, i was pretty excited to try the Banana Cream Pie, but it was pretty average.  It had  A LOT of bananas and didn't really blow me away with flavor.   It was like eating a big banana with whip cream.  I probably wouldn't get it again.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The service was pretty good, but i wish they didn't sit us right next to the kitchen entrance.  It gets annoying to have people constantly walking by you with food and dishes.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Went for lunch waited almost five minutes for any type of service (was not busy). Ordered appetizers chips and gumbo they were very good. Then the\n",
      " bad. We ordered two burgers one medium one medium well. Both came medium rare at best. Sent them back, they put the burgers back on the grill. Came back mine was supposed to be medium well was medium. My wife's was supposed to be medium was medium rare. Both came back on blood soaked buns WOW.  We were disappointed. It did get better the pecan pie with ice cream was very good.  Also our server was very nice once he came to the table. So for the poor burger and blood soaked bun I have to give three stars.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] All I can say is -- get rid of the salt! Wow, food was just okay but the salt level was overboard.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My experience is from dining at the bar. I never discount the bar as an option for a wonderful evening. It honestly is the best way for a single diner or even two people to enjoy a nice evening without the pretense of an uppity experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend and I came to Delmonico, dressed in tank tops and jeans, so we found an open spot up front. The bartenders are friendly and just as polished as any server. The recommendations for red pairing with our bone in ribeye to the port at the end was perfection. We started our meal off with the steak tartare. It has to be the second best in the city. I wished they would use a quail egg to dress it instead of a chicken's. Moving on to our entree, we split the ribeye and it was more than enough for the both of us. Add a side of the haricot vert with sauteed shallots and it is the perfect meal. Being in an Emeril restaurant we we had to finish with one of his specialty desserts. I tend to not be a big pie fan, so we went with the bread pudding. It is decadent and comes in a generous portion. No one person should be able to polish one off on their own. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is one of those restaurants were I would not even bother with getting a table and would prefer to eat out at the bar.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Excellent, excellent service. That is the one thing I remember about this restaurant. Everyone who served my party of 4 was so professional from start to finish. The head waiter gave us great recommendations on what steak to select, and which wine would go well with it. I was amazed at all of the little details including refolding my table cloth while I was away at the restroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food was 5/5 - all of us ordered a medium-rare bone-in ribeye. It was the biggest and juiciest steak I've ever had. Quite unfortunate that I was not able to finish the last third, the serving was that large. Yes, the check for 4 people ended up being several hundred dollars but it was worth every single cent for the dining experience.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Exquisite in every sense of the word!\n",
      "\n",
      "Get ready for a dining experience like no other, with all the choices to dine in Las Vegas, this is something extraordinary! We walked in and were warmly greeted by the hostesses and seated quickly in the beautiful dining room of classic romantic design. Our table was impeccably set with china banded in red, trimmed in gold, similar to that of the GW Bush era at the White House. We had a friendly, attentive staff of four serving us our Chateaubriand, sauteed tableside, that was so tender and done to perfection the knives we were given surely were for decoration - we did not need to use them. I highly recommend this dining experience if you are interested in a romantic, classic setting with a menu and wine list fit for the king and queen that you are :) Do give the Duck Egg Creme Brulee' a try - it was marvelous!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I am not absolutely dying to go back, but I grew up in Las Vegas and can say that this one of the finer fine dining establishments. My mom, her boyfriend, my sister, and I ate here for a special occasion post-Phantom and there wasn't a single mentionable flaw in the experience. Everything was fresh, perfectly cooked to order, and tasted great. The service was attentive (though perhaps the tiniest bit slow toward the end of our meal) and friendly. \n",
      "\n",
      "The ambiance was nice, excluding the \"old ladies' night out\" table nearby making a lot of drunken noise (they were just enjoying themselves but boy did one of them have a memorable cackle!) and would be suitable for a nice date.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recommend the caesar composed tableside as well as the tomato salads to begin with. I enjoyed my seared tuna and the steak and scallops I tasted were excellent, as was the tiramisu for dessert .\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I recently stayed two nights in Vegas. I went to B&B one night and Delmonico the second. The food was excellent quality at both places. But the service and the atmosphere fell very short at Delmonico's. I was dining alone so maybe the server didn't think he needed to attend to me but the night before I had amazing service at B&B so I had an expectation of what a $100 dining experience should be like. \n",
      "\n",
      "I told the server I would like a glass of red wine when my steak was delivered. I waited ten minutes before it was brought out. I used to wait tables... for a decade. I'm a reasonable patron. I think fine dining demands something above diner level service.\n",
      "\n",
      "So despite a delicious steak and a tasty martini, the rowdy classless crowd and the crappy service will keep me from coming back.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Having eaten here now a handful of times, I felt it was time to finally leave a review (not that they need it, based on their stars.) That having been said, it's really hard to go wrong with a steak here! The NY strip is huge, delicious, and, in my experience, cooked to perfection. The sides, while pretty standard fare, are quite good. I find the creamed spinach and mushrooms to be particularly noteworthy, while the asparagus was uninspired. The value is reasonable, in spite of the fairly high price, so no complaints there. With the number of great options in the Venetian/Palazzo, let alone in Las Vegas in its entirety, it can be hard to stand out, but Delmonico Steakhouse manages to do so.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Once again Emeril's Delmonico has lived up to its world class reputation! We took our friend and her husband here last night for her 40th birthday and the night couldn't have been more perfect! \n",
      "\n",
      "Staff/Service - exceptional! I think every person on the staff we interacted with wished her a happy birthday and even brought out a small dessert at the end of dinner. The sommelier stopped by our table several times and selected a great bottle for the table. He even came back at the end of dinner to talk about what Texas wines we recommend. Truly exceptional service. \n",
      "\n",
      "Drinks - you have to try one of their Sazeracs. \n",
      "\n",
      "Food- blows me away how exceptional the food is here. Ribeye was cooked absolutely perfect medium rare. Charred on outside. Perfect seasoning.  Duck fat fingering potatoes were also delicious. \n",
      "\n",
      "Couldn't have been happier to visit Delmonico and can't wait to go back!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Outstanding lobster bisque and gumbo. Got a bit loud at times with large groups, but we enjoyed a delicious ribeye and filet. Both are good choices.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] At ces trade show and looking for lunch. I show up at 2:03 and the host jokingly says we are closed. We laughed. But he meant it. Last year my burger ordered medium came out almost raw. I am never going back\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I would give this 4.5 stars if I could. My husband and I sat at the bar for a couple snacks. We ended up getting Emeril's red wine blend, which was surprisingly good and $9. Not too bad for Vegas. We also got his bbq shrimp and gumbo. Both were really good. I loved the little biscuit that came with the shrimp. The sauce with the shrimp was a rich deep color with lots of flavor. Not your traditional BBQ shrimp. The gumbo wasn't spicey, but had a nice flavor. We also got complimentary \"sweet\" rolls (maybe yeast?) with our shrimp and gumbo. They were SOOO good! Great experience!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This has definitely been the best Steak in Las Vegas that I have had yet. \n",
      "\n",
      "Not only were my date and I able to get a table last minute w/o a reservation - but our wait staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. I was given two wines to try based on my meal choice, and stuck with an Aussie Syrah that was to die for. \n",
      "\n",
      "We were given no attitude when we told the server that we wanted to share the bone in ribeye($52) which was fab given our desire to try other menu items w/o emptying our pockets completely. \n",
      "\n",
      "Started off with the Blue Cheese Apple Salad ($16) which had these grapes (that I originally thought were olives until I bit into them) I can only describe as being totally delicious. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then we picked the garlic sauteed mushrooms and asparagus for sides (all sides $9) The shrooms were wonderful, lots of flavor and definitely went well with the meat. The asparagus was cooked right, but I would say it lacked flavor, we had to sprinkle salt over it, and that is a downer for me at a nice restaurant. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our Bone in Rib Eye steak, which was split for us by the kitchen no questions asked, ... except for one \"Who get's the bone?\" \"I Get the Bone!\" I replied! \n",
      "\n",
      "Ordered along with a side of raw horse radish and their signature steak sauce ... The Rib Eye was cooked to perfection. I order my steak Med Rare (even though I like it bloody) because I've found in the past nicer steakhouses tend to cook on the rare side. True to form, it was cooked amazingly well. Very pink, and extremely tender. Every bite seemed to remind me of a fillet which is unusual for that cut of meat, it just melted in your mouth then, after my date made sure I wouldn't offend anyone by asking if they minded me chewing on the bone like a dog with table scraps ;) - I did just that \n",
      "\n",
      "I'd also like to mention that if you have a choice, I would ask for Todd to be your server, he was a delight to talk to, and payed us a lot of attention - which is more than I can say for the staff at Stack inside the Mirage :( \n",
      "\n",
      "Our entire bill was only $110 and we were both full and satisfied. I would go back to Delmonico's again in a heartbeat.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Good food.  Great steak/beef tartare (did I spell that correctly?).  Pretty darn good service as well.  From an ambience standpoint, this place is leagues better than Prime (not too many tables, decent lighting, not a lot of room noise) but not as cool as some of the newer rooms in Vegas.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, a good place to go for steak.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Took my fiancé here for our 5 year anniversary since he is such a fan of steak.  To be honest, I always felt that if you've been to one steakhouse, you've been to them all.  But that doesn't mean the food was any less delicious.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The truffle chips were crunchy and packed with flavor and the salmon tartare was delicious!  We also ordered the bone in filet, which was a little on the salty side but the meat was perfectly tender...but what I was extremely excited about was the foie gras (banned in California).  The order of foie gras was plentiful and just heaven paired with the steak.  \n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The service is perfect! Our glass was never even half empty! The steak is perfect! It is making my mouth water just thinking about it now. Yes it is $50- ish for a steak- but it is totally worth it! They even sent out a little green tea ice cream treat to say \"happy anniversary.\"\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] went for dinner tonight. Amazing my husband had lobster bisque and the T bone both were delish.I had the French onion soup and the pan seared duck. Cooked to perfection and I'm still raving about the flavor. If you are ever in Vegas this is a must try.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This is one of the most amazing restaurant I've ever had. I made a reservation for Fourth of July for my boyfriend's birthday. The service was 5 stars, my water was never below one sip level. We had three servers for our table. I've been waiting for their bone in ribeye as review said it was good. It was better than I expected. We had two appetizers beef cappacio and table side  Caesar salad, halibut, delicious! And caramel cake dessert was perfect. The servers had also given us a birthday banana walnut ice cream. Highly recommend this place!\n",

      "I recently came to Vegas from DC for a bachelor party and this was our one \"nice\" meal for the weekend. I decided to eat the Wagyu and it came with mashed sweet potato. It was sooo good. Cooked awesomely by the chef. What made it even better was eating it with the many sides we ordered. Surprisingly I loved the cream of spinach, but my favorite side was the potato gratin. Unfortunately there are so many different places to eat in Vegas...I don't know if I'll ever get to come back here.\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] First time here at Delmonico. We came for my b/d birthday as he loves Emeril. Already disappointed by the delay of service. I had to call a server to order bottle of wine and it was explained to us we had to give waitress a number! As we waiting I could observe they tailor more quickly to the larger groups of guests! I hope the food is better than the service. Being an elegant restaurant with hefty prices you would expect a sophisticated bathroom right? Noope down a long hall down to a back room and voila looks like a strip mall bathroom!!!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Very impressive service and fine steaks. The wine list is most impressive with some great wines at reasonable prices. Well done\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Loved it! Went to Delmonico Steakhouse a few days ago with a group of friends, and absolutley loved the food and the service. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Service:  The service was impeccable.  I've seen better (well only one other place could beat their service) but Delmonico put Ruth's Chris and Mortons to SHAME. Yes, I said it... to shame.  That's how great they are. Drank one inch of water, and was immediately refilled with another inch.  Drank one inch of wine, and was immediately refilled.  Food was brought on very reasonable time.  Though if I could complain, I would've wanted the staff to be a little more friendlier.  Felt they were being a little less friendly because of our age.  But I'll let it slide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food: I can complain NOTHING about the food! The food was fantastic.  The best steak I've ever ate, hands down! Was worth every penny (or should I say dollar).  Even the baked potato was super good (and it's just a regular baked potato!) Its as good as it gets.\n",

      "\n",
      "After looking over the menu, I ordered the lobster bisque, creamed corn and a bone in rib eye steak.  After ordering, I was given warm rolls which I quickly ate three of them.....they were fluffy, and super tasty with butter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lobster bisque was outstanding.....very creamy and full of lobster flavor.   I thought Craftsteak, Capital Grille and the Palm had the best lobster bisque....Delmonico's is right up there with being one of the best.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Came here with my family on a Saturday evening over a holiday and got seated right away. The atmosphere itself was nice and the restaurant wasn't very busy, but one of the first things I noticed was that it usually took a lot more effort than I would expect at a nice restaurant that wasn't crowded to begin with to get our server's attention. The servers themselves were great and always helpful but just seemed to be pretty absent most of the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food itself was very good. The pre-dinner rolls were light, which I liked so you didn't get too full on bread before your actual meal came. I ordered the BBQ Salmon. A lot of other plates at our table were the rib-eyes. Everything was cooked perfectly, and my only complaint might be that the salmon was really heavy on BBQ sauce. Portions were large enough to be worth the price, but it really depended on the items ordered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall 5 for food, 3 for service.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Had the ribeye bone-in with foie gras on top. The best steak of my life.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The service here is great and so is their steak!  I had the ribeye steak here and it was SOOO good!  There was so much flavor in it and i havent tasted a steak like this in a lonnng time.  It was really cooked to perfection the way it was cooked.... words cannot even describe.  I wished I could have steaks like this more often. \n",

      "The waiters were also so nice.  We had a show to catch and they made sure we got outta there on time.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My 4th time going to the restaurant and it didn't disappoint. Made reservations for 9pm but I forgot where it was. Made the mad scramble for 2 blocks. When I called the woman who answered said no problem. The bartender was exceptional, stearing me towards a good whiskey. Of course the steak itself. To describe the steak would only cheapen the experience. Very worth the money.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Fantastic meal and service. I had the filet mignon and my husband had the BBQ salmon. We each ordered a salad (mine the organic greens and his the heirloom tomato and cheese--superb!) and shared the creamed corn. Thank you for the delicious New Years Day meal. We will not forget it and highly recommend coming here for a nice dinner out. .\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Was excited to go here since it was Emerille's Steakhouse.  We had reservations for 8PM and waited at the bar while they got our table ready. The waiter was really nice and friendly.  They brought us bread which they placed individually on our plates. I started with the spinach and arugula salad, which was super good. I was glad to have had that in my stomach, since it took a while to get our steaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the filet, medium and a side of asparagus.  The steak was seared a little too much and tasted a little burnt.  They also topped it off with a pad of butter.  By no means was it a bad steak, but for the price, I guess I expected more.  The asparagus was good but also very buttery.  Good food, but I have definitely had better.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Enjoyed the meal. $50 for a filet mignon. Cooked to perfection. The creamed spinach ($9)  might be the best I ever had. A nice flavor. Sort of had a hint of wood burned flavor added to it. The bread that was served with it was like a Yorkshire pudding that had a slight wood burned taste...excellent. The coffee was less than average. The service was excellent.  (Only odd thing...when the crumbs were cleaned off the table while I was between a course, they were not cleaned to a plate, but the empty chair).\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] In my opinion it's not fit for a foodie. Meal was very good but not superb. However, service was great. I wasn't impressed by their BBQ shrimp which was highly recommended as their signature appetizer.  Fish was cooked perfectly but most of the food only had 2 dimensions.  I expected more complexity and excitement in their flavors. Overall great for a cocktail and a good meal but Las Vegas has so many places in this category. I would love a large well known restaurant on the strip to go above and beyond. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you aren't adventurous and just want a good meal with all your great basics on the menu this is perfect. It's a crowd pleaser but definitely lacking in excitement. \n",

      "If I were to rate the food it would only be 3 stars but the service is very good so I gave them 4 stars. I will be back for drinks but it wouldn't be my first choice for food.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Highty recommend the Chateaubriand steak to share  -- it was melt in your mouth delicious!  It was priciest of teh 3 restaurants we ate at over the long weekend but by far the best service.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My ribeye was a tiny bit drier than I like, and our bottle of wine was a twist off.  I was very surprised that they even carried this at such a \"high end\" restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only saving grace was their truffle and parmesan potato chips.  Although it looked like dish from the local sports bar, it tasted great.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the greatest time having dinner here, but I'd have to say it was about the company and not the food.  Totally not worth the money.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Not much to say that hasn't already been covered by previous reviews. Good steak (although I've had better), great rolls (freebies!) and the Tale of Two Cherries cocktail was excellent and unique.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Great food, great staff.  Came for a steak, a steak is what I got.  Sides were amazing but not needed especially after my soup.  Never had to ask for water, never had to fill up my own wine glass.  Staff was excellent.  Knew before hand about dietary needs and overcame them.  I would defiantly recommend if you coming or stating near the palazzo.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] How can you screw up on Boned in New York twice? Come to Delmonico's.  Medium means Well Done.  No pink what so ever.  And they even cooked two steaks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Is your steak fine? After all your friends have eaten? Yes.  It's fine because I don't want to wait around for you to screw up anymore.  \n",

      "Only saving grace was the bourbon.  \n",

      "Basically, screwed up on steak.  Luke warm coffee.  Oh hell, might be a bad night, but my five other friends had good dinners.  Didn't want to bitch and spoil their evening.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Incredible service! Made a reservation even though it was after 4th of July weekend. I was glad we had one, it was still packed on a monday night! There were eight of us, my friend's daughter brought her new Build A Bear puppy, and the server brought a setting and high chair for the puppy! How cute is that?? we ordered a bunch of appetizers, the fried calamari was light and crisp, bbq shrimp's sauce was thick and sweet but yet savory, shrimp cocktail should be named prawn cocktail, and the squash ravioli - again, it's the sauce that did it, yum. Every time I see lobster bisque, I order it for the kids, they LOVE it - creamy, velvety with chunks of lobsters. Hubby had the ribeye steak, I had the filet mignon, took a bite of my friends' beef medallion and colorado rack of lamb. I think the ribeye steak and lamb came out the winner. Very juicy and tender, with a little bit burnt on the fat, perfection! We shared the banana cream pie, banana pudding, creme brulee for desserts. The pudding was no doubt the winner, the others are good, but if you can only order one, have the pudding. Again, expensive, but money well spent. Will come back again for sure!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I cannot say enough about this place. The steak was no doubt the absolute best I've ever had, the shrimp was excellent as well. Had a fabulous wine. ordered a variety of desserts  my favorite was the banana cream pie. Can't wait to go back!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The best steak and the best service.  I just wish there was a Delmonico around where I live.  My boyfriend and I travel to Las Vegas just for Delmonico.  We absolutely love it!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Oooohhhhhhhhhhh this place is orgasmic!  I can't even begin to tell you how in love I am with this establishment.  It's amazing.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The boyfriend and I were in Vegas for our anniversary and he made reservations at Delmonico.  I was excited :) \n",
      "\n",
      "When we were being lead to our seats, we oohed and awwed about how beautiful the restaurant was.  The ceilings and structure reminded us of the Conciergerie in France.  Very pretty.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, we were seated and given a very extensive wine list--some wines upward of $3000.  We opted for a glass of wine.  We opened the menu and no more than 5 minutes later, we knew exactly what we were going to order--scallops and gnocchi in basil butter sauce, lobster bisque, and two bone in ny strips cooked medium rare.  No sides--we wanted the beef.  \n",
      "\n",
      "About 10 minutes after we ordered, the waiter brought out a complimentary amuse-bouche.  Two puff pastries with bleu cheese mousse and walnuts.  They wanted to wish us a happy anniversary! How wonderful is that?  My bf was very surprised--when he had booked the reservation they asked him if it was for a special occassion.  He was very surprised they did something about it.  Well, it was delicious.  Now we were even more enthusiastic about the food.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lobster bisque came next, and it was fantastic.  Creamy and perfectly seasoned.  The scallops (2 huge scallops to be exact) came next and were wonderful.  Perfectly seared on the outside and tender on the inside.  \n",
      "\n",
      "And the steak...oh boy.  It's huge!  It came out seared on the outside with a dollop of herbed butter.  I couldn't wait to get at it. It was perfectly red on the inside.  This was hands down the best steak I've ever had in my life.  It was seared so perfectly, that the fat around the edges of the steak were crispy (yes, I actually a good helping of the fat. It's better than butter!)  The food was amazing and we ate as much as we could--leaving behind almost nothing at all.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Still, we wanted dessert.  Pecan pie a la mode with caramel sauce. Fanfreakingtastic!!!  Delicious! The waiter told us it was the best pecan pie he had had in his life, and I concur.  Yummy! \n",
      "\n",
      "I only have high praises for this place.  Aside from the food, the staff was attentive and gracious.  We can't wait to go back--even if the $200 bill hurt a bit.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Food was excellent!  Obviously pricey, but I knew that in advance. \n",
      "Service was a little slow getting started, seemed like waitress had too many tables, but then got better. \n",
      "Loved everything.  Potato au gratin was a bit overly garlicky, and I love garlic.  I couldnt really eat them.\n",
      "Had a fabulous Malbec, Loca Linda.  \n",
      "\n",
      "no fears about going again!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The fact that we were able to change our reservation for 8 people, three different times on a very crowded Mothers Day weekend should've been my first clue that this wasn't going to be a great meal. The steaks had absolutely NO flavor, the options weren't good and the ahi salad with a whopping 3 small pieces of tuna was far from worth the cost. I come to the Venetian very often as an invited guest and have never had such a sub-par dining experience. With so many other great options don't bother with this one....\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Delmonico Steakhouse is the BEST steakhouse I have ever been to. HANDS DOWN. NOTHING else compares. I have been going to this steakhouse for the past 8 years. Pretty much every time I visit Vegas; we find a way to to have dinner there. I have tried the pork chops for dinner. But my \"go to\" entree is ALWAYS the RIB EYE. It is done to PERFECTION. Always EXPERTLY cooked and seasoned. TENDER and almost MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH. The sign of an EXCELLENT STEAKHOUSE - is that your steak is ALWAYS cooked to order and does not need much in the area of extra sauces. Your steak comes with an assortment of Emeril's sauces. I have never needed them and prefer to eat the steak \"as is\". Service is IMPECCABLE. Your drinks are brought quickly. Your water glass is never empty. Entrees and side dishes are delectable beyond your dreams. Also, the most AMAZING Banana Cream Pie I have ever had the pleasure of eating in my Life. TRUST ME. Spending money at Delmonico Steakhouse is WELL SPENT and I doubt you will be disappointed. It is a true dining EXPERIENCE.\n",

      "Not remembering that we had dined at Emeril's in Orlando, I ordered Gumbo. And as it turns out, it is the exact same Gumbo that I had at Emeril's restaurant in Florida. Go figure. We also had some fish sitting on a bed of what looked like, well, vomit. BUT nevertheless, the dish was good and the stringy fried potatoes on top were crunchy and tasty.\n",

      "When deciding on restaurant for my friend's BIG 3-OH B-Day dinner, it was between CUT, N9NE, and Delmonico's. After YELPING and looking over all the menus, Delmonico's was the winner because it was conveniently located in The Venetian (we were staying at the Palazzo), decently priced compared to CUT, and had rave reviews about the bone-in ribeye. \n",
      "\n",
      "RESERVATIONS: \n",
      "Making reservations was quick and simple. You can make reservations directly through the restaurant as opposed to The Wynn Restaurants where you have to call their restaurant hotline number and the wait is 20+ minutes.\n",

      "On Friday, March 4, 2010, our party of 9 arrived around 7:15 PM. As we were escorted to our table, we couldn't help but notice the shape of our table. A round table was connected to a rectangular table which errr, resembled a male part. Don't know if it was intentional since I told them it was my male's friend's b-day party? Anyhow, it made for a good laugh. \n",
      "\n",
      "FOOD:\n",
      "*Lobster Bisque ($12.50): Rich, velvety smooth with generous chunks of sweet tender lobster equals YUMMYNESS! The only complaint is it was a bit too salty for my taste. Four of my friends also had the bisque and complained about the same thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "*16 oz Bone-in Ribeye ($52): One word...WOW! The bone-in ribeye, aged for 8 weeks was one the most flavorful steaks I've ever tasted! The ribeye was cooked to a perfect medium rare with nice charred crust and a pink center. You can tell that the marbling slowly melted and basted the meat during the cooking process producing a rich, amazingly tender, and savory cut of meat. Aside from the Kobe from Craftsteak, this is hands-down the best steak ever; and for the price point, you really can't go wrong. If there weren't anyone watching, I would have literally grabbed the ribeye by the bone and gone to town cave-man style--it was THAT good!\n",
      "\n",
      "*Creamed Spinach ($9): DELISH! The spinach was extremely fresh and maintained a vibrant green in the velvety and savory sauce. It was well-seasoned w/o being too salty and complemented the steak perfectly. \n",
      "\n",
      "*Creamed Corn Gratinee ($9): OMG good--it tasted like a mac & cheese made with corn. The creamed corn was sweet and tender and was topped with a panko breadcrumb crust which gave a nice crunch to the dish. It was an explosion of flavor and texture combos in your mouth...sweet, savory, buttery, and crunchy.\n",
      "\n",
      "SERVICE:\n",
      "Impeccable service, although a little pretentious at times. I guess you would expect nothing less from an upscale restaurant like Delmonico's. When it came down to serving our entrees, it was like a symphony as the waiters/waitresses served our dishes in-synch with one another to create a \"ta-daa\" moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would have given Delmonico's a 4.5 star rating, however, they allowed Freed's to deliver a b-day cake and didn't charge a slicing fee.\n",
      "\n",
      "AMBIANCE/DÉCOR: \n",
      "Normally steakhouses have a very \"dark\" ambiance. However, Delmonico's was the complete opposite. It was well-lit with Ivory walls and ceilings with accent cobblestone walls, crisp white linens and chestnut furniture created a very simple, yet elegant feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm ALL about splurging when on vacation. Go big OR go home right? And, when you're in Vegas, you definitely have to go BIG--so, what are you waiting for? Go on and get your Bone-In Ribeye ON!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I absolutely love treated myself to an awesome steak dinner at least once a month. Was there last week for March Madness and came here with my boyfriend and a couple other friends. Our server, Frank, was amazing!!! We all felt really comfortable with him and felt at home. He made our experience very memorable. We talked about music, life, our home heritage and all sorts of stuff. I hope he's working next time we are in town. As for the food I ordered the wagyu filet which was thee best piece of meat I've ever had!!!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] So, after several years of not eating at an restaurant of Mr. Lagasse, I finally made it to Delmonico's.  Why might you ask?  Well for one reason - the bone in aged rib-eye steak.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the third Emeril restaurant that I've eaten at.  I used to live in New Orleans and ate at his first restaurant, Emeril's, and his casual outpost, NOLA, several times.  The food was good at times, not so great at other times, but the one thing that was constant was the excellent service.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Delmonico's continues that tradition.  The service is excellent.  At times, it's a little too friendly, but attentive and not overbearing.  Food came out at a very good pace, allowing for long conversations without interruption.  And the decor is so understated and clean.  It really is a nice change from all of the typical Vegas restaurants with loud lighting and faux-glam decor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because my girlfriend was so eager to try Emeril's food (she's a big fan), we started off with some classics - barbecued shrimp (New Orleans style) and shrimp cocktail with remoulade sauce.  The lunch menu usually has shrimp remoulade over fried green tomatoes.  However, it wasn't on the menu and I really wanted my girlfriend to try it.  The waiter was nice enough to accommodate my request, learned they had some prepared and served it with the shrimp cocktail.  To drink, she ordered a glass of Loosen Bros.  \"Dr. L Estate\" Riesling and I ordered a glass of Laurent Perrier NV Champagne. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Riesling was recommended by the Asst. Sommelier.  The waiter initially recommended an Australian white blend.  But to me, it didn't seem like the best match with the barbecued shrimp because it lacked the acidity to cut the richness of the dish.  When I commented to the Sommelier that I thought the Australian white had Viognier in it, he said it definitely did.  As we talked more, he said the Riesling was a \"perfect match\" for the barbecued shrimp.  You know what?  It was.  My girlfriend wolfed down half of the barbecued shrimp, taking a sip of the Riesling with each bite.  She even raved - it was a perfect match.  And she also loved the remoulade.  The barbecued shrimp were cooked well, I noticed one of the shrimp I had was a little tough, but the remaining shrimp were plump and juicy.  The shrimp cocktail was great.  Cold, large shrimp, moist, juicy and firm.  They were perfect with the remoulade sauce.\n",
      "\n",
      "From there, we split the bone-in rib eye which was cooked ABSOFRIGGINLUTELY PERFECTLY MED-RARE TO MED.  It wasn't charred, but had that crunch of a good high-temp seared steak.  The twice baked potato with bacon and cheese was sinfully great.  The asparagus was sauteed with garlic and shallots, cooked perfectly through with still a slight crunch.  We shared a half bottle of 2003 Pine Ridge Crimson Creek Merlot which was a good match for the steak.  It had good balance, acidity, but enough soft fruit to please my girlfriend, who doesn't like tannic wines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dessert was banana cream pie for her, pecan pie for me.  Both were excellent.  The banana cream pie wasn't as sweet as expected, which made it even more easy to eat.  She ordered an espresso martini made with espresso (not the flavored vodka), I ordered a glass of 2003 Carmes de Rieussec Sauternes and finished with a cup of chicory coffee to finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was it inexpensive? Of course not.  It was quite expensive.  But for the excellent quality of food (far, far, far better than Gallagher's and probably the second best only to Bouchon of the restaurants I've eaten at in Vegas) and the best service I've had in Vegas (yes, better than Bouchon), it was worth it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Why 5 stars?  Because everything went right.  Was the service perfect? Almost.  Was the food perfect?  Almost.  Were the drinks perfect?  Almost.  Adding that all together with the right person I wanted to share the evening with, it was perfect.  (Although I didn't ever finish my French Laundry review, that place IS nearly perfect with whoever you go with.  It is still to this day, the best eating experience I have ever had and I've had the fortune of going there 3 times now.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Now if I could only remember the name of the Asst. Sommelier, I would give him a shout out here.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I am once again a fan of Emeril.  But please, no \"BAM.\"\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I'll start with this: I'm not a fan of Emeril Lagasse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why? I don't know. I've never really been a fan. When Food Network showed actual shows instead of Guy Fieri and his 90's hair, Emeril, Bobby Flay, Tyler Florence, and Giada ruled the network. Oh, and Michael Chiarello, but I've been to his restaurant and that was phenomenal. That aside, BAM! was the most popular saying in the food world, people flipped their shit over it, and now Emeril has his face on every cheaply made saucepan and spice around grocery stores for twice the markup. I always thought he was off-putting.\n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, this is a seafood/steakhouse, and it's upscale. I've been to CUT, so I know that Wolfgang Puck is better than his canned soups. There's a chance Emeril would live up to the (very pricey) hype.\n",
      "\n",
      "The drinks were good - a cab and a pinot noir were actually quite nice, and the cocktails looked amazing. Maybe your bar staff can teach your kitchen staff a little something about pride in their product.\n",
      "\n",
      "First up: the vine-ripened heirloom tomato salad with burrata. Am I supposed to eat through the thick, rock hard center of this tomato? Are you serious? I paid $20+ for a salad that consisted of five slices of heirloom tomato and a dollop of burrata on top, and you're going to give me several slices that were pure unripened tomato? Fuckin hell. I was disappointed. Okay? So disappointed. Come on, how fucking hard is it to serve a RIPE tomato?\n",
      "\n",
      "For the entree we ordered the wagyu ribeye and the ahi tuna. The tuna was fine - it was tuna. I'd opt for two pieces, as pepper crusted seared ahi for me can get overwhelming after a while (nigiri is a totally different situation). The battered mushrooms were a nice touch, as well as the sauce.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the wagyu. Okay, look. You're paying $90 for a fucking steak. For a steak that ISN'T KOBE - please, for the love of god, don't confuse the two. And it's not big, it's small. Is it wonderfully marbled with fat? Yes! To me, it was great! I thought it was wonderful! But this is why my review just went down a star while writing this:\n",
      "\n",
      "When you pay $90 for a goddamn steak, you'd better bring it out hot. Like, searing hot. Like on a 400F plate like Mastros, hot. RIGHT off the goddamn pan hot. When it comes out just barely hot anymore, and then slips right into lukewarm, what the fuck? What kind of $90 experience is that? The cow has given it's life, with the production of so many people trying to make it wonderful, and you RUIN the experience. Plus it was a little too salty.\n",
      "\n",
      "You're probably thinking, \"Jesus Jaime, you're a bit of a prick, and a snob. I can see your brain from how high you're holding your nose from here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, alright. I'll give you that. But you know what? I'm not going to pay fucking $90 for a goddamn steak if it isn't treated PERFECTLY. I can get a $25 steak that's handled better than that, I don't give a fuck if it hasn't been drinking beer all its life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, to top off the evening of great disappointments, I ordered dessert. How HARD is it to fuck this up? When you have a great meal, you want to finish it with a bang, right? So you have the one thing on the menu people like (apparently the banana cream pie), and then fuck it to the rest of the dessert menu, right? For fucks sake people, GREAT dessert isn't that hard! It's SO EASY. Even worse, it's the biggest profit maker! If you call that Chocolate Truffle Cake a CAKE when it's drier than the Sahara desert, and that Strawberry Shortcake as such when there was barely any actual shortcake, AND the strawberries were mostly unripened with green parts on them, with a dollop of whipped cream on the side of the plate...then you should send your Pastry Chef back to school because clearly they need a kick in the ass.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is an expensive meal where they prey off the idea that the people who come don't have any appreciation for the things they serve, so their level of care goes right out the 37th floor window of any hotel on the Strip.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This place is perfect. Love eating here. Its my top pick for steak in Vegas. I try to go every time I'm in town. Love the bone in ribeye. Lots of good drinks to. Its a must.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Now this is the way good food is suppose to make you feel!!  Excellent! My filet was superb, melt in your mouth good and cooked to perfection. Wife ordered the Red snapper which was amazing. No fishy linger at all, just delicious! Overall this place is great and service is top notch! This steakhouse is a must\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I would give Delmonico a 2.5 or even more if it was available but as it's 2 or 3 unfortunately for them I have to go with 2. There were so many pluses for the meal that I feel bad about rating the restaurant low. However, the overall experience was not what I wanted, and for a  meal of this price I have pretty achievable expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "For starters, the sevice was immaculate and I mean truly immaculate, the servers work as a team and they we're amazing. From recommending wines to full descriptions of food, and even drinks, they were aces. The wine list had so many rare and amazing finds that you could get lost searching, thankfully the staff was able to help us pick out one perfect for our tastes and meal. For the appetizer, bone in bacon, we'll if you didn't think it would be absolutely amazing by the name I can promise you, words do not describe how amazing this appetizer is. It truly is memorizing. Try it, and you'll understand. \n",
      "\n",
      "For dinner I had a filet and he had a bone in ribeye, their signature cut. Unfortunately  my husband had to send his steak back due to being substantially overlooked. Again, the waitstaff immediately addressed the issue and apologized agreeing with my husband that not only was the steak overlooked, but it was substantially overlooked, ie, the steak was ordered medium rare and came out between medium well and well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The waitstaff removed the steak from the table and after a few minutes brought my husband a second steak, most notable on the second steak was the fact that the steak butter was not melted, leading us to believe that the  steak was brought directly from the grill to the table, no time to rest under a lamp and overcook itself, a plus we thought. Until my husband cut into the second ribeye, again their signature steak, again substantially overlooked. At this point the server, who was speaking with my husband about the meal and appologizing about the previous steak appeared appalled that again, the steak was substantially overdone. He appeared embarrassed for the issues. We were promised no matter what it would be made up for and even the manager immediately addressed my husband and appeared completely appalled that the steak was so overdone, for a second time, (this time closer to medium well, maybe a high medium, but still nowhere near medium rare.) \n",
      "\n",
      "The manager and server traded apologies and promised to make things right. Due to the fact that I had only had half of my filet, my husband opted to not receive another ribeye, instead choosing to just finish my meal. The server and manager happily took the ribeye off and purchased us two desserts for the troubles and issues. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the good, the menu is amazing. In it's entirety, I believe it rivals some of the best steakhouses around. The lobster bisque is by far the best I've had, and as a fan of lobster bisque, I've had it at several 4 and 5 star restaurants all over the United States. Presentation, flavor, texture, everything was amazing. \n",
      "\n",
      "The bone in bacon, if I didn't convince you before, it is one of the most flavorful dishes I have ever had, the watermelon is a little strange sounding but brings out so much flavor that again, I just can't put it into words, you have to experience this dish!\n",
      "\n",
      "My filet oscar was great, perfectly cooked, very flavorful and perfectly seasoned. I just wish I had a second stomach to finish it after almost licking the plate of lobster bisque and bone in bacon. \n",
      "\n",
      "Desserts were great as everything else, and the after dinner drink list is as expansive as the wine list. If you can imagine it, they have it. \n",
      "\n",
      "My only issue is my husbands meal, again I feel bad because I understand mistakes happen, but it was very unfortuonate that for a dinner to celebrate our first annivarsary, at the end he/we were disappointed. He continued to describe it as \"the food was amazing, but not what I was hoping for.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "I personally have issues with a $300 meal (granted $130 of it being an amazing and perfectly reccomended bottle of wine,) being disappointing in any way. Again mistakes happen and I believe firmly that they are rare at Delmonicos, but I cannot change this disappointing experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "If this is the only negative review that you read please do not discount this restaurant. Again, mistakes happen, and even as I write this, I feel bad for not giving the restaurant better ratings because so many things were good and accidents happen, but it doesn't change the experience tonight. Hopefully, as it appeared, this will be a rare experience and we may give this restaurant another shot the next time we're in Vegas, but as this was supposed to be a special meal celebrating, I will say disappointing is the best way to describe it. The restaurant has so much more potential and obviously could have done so much better than we experienced, we were just unlucky. Again, no fault on the waitstaff, they were amazing, but overall experience was disappointing. I hope others have better luck than we did.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Just as good the second time around!  Near perfect steak dinner, but not perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place is worth a repeat visit.  I really have to compliment the wait staff at this restaurant.  It seemed like there were more workers than patrons the night we were there.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Caesar Salad - I was very tempted to order an appetizer, but my gf reminded me we were about to eat over a pound of meat so we decided to share the caesar salad.  It was prepared table side by our waiter.  It was decent and a nice way to prepare my stomach for the main course.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bone-in Ribeye - Mine was cooked perfectly and well seasoned.  My particular cut was very, very tender.  My gf order the exact same steak and it wasn't nearly as good.  I had to share parts of my steak with her and we took the rest of hers to go.  Hers wasn't bad, it just wasn't as good as mine.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Sides - We ordered the creamed corn and asparagus.   The corn was very good.  It had a nice crust on the top and went well with my steak.  The asparagus was pretty plain.  I had to throw salt and pepper on it otherwise it was completely tasteless.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Dessert - We ordered the banana cream pie.  I have no idea why we chose it, but I'm glad we did.  I would have usually ordered something chocolaty with ice cream but the banana cream pie sounded good.  Well, it was good.  Really good.  When it came out, I thought it was going to be way too sweet with all the caramel and chocolate shavings, but it wasn't.  We weren't even hungry after our meal, but we managed to put the entire dessert down.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the food was good.  I have to give it 4 stars for the boring asparagus and inconsistent steak.  The wait staff was awesome.  They can have 5 stars.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Last night I had the salmon with a side of grits followed up by that he banana cream pie. It is amazing how good food can be! Just loved it. The food is pricey but if you want to give yourself a treat then this is the place to go.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The best bone-in rib eye steak I've ever had.  I recommend getting it medium so the fatty goodness gets enough heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The calamari and truffle oil potato chips were also fantastic.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was nice and professional.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bill was huge.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] So overall the food was amazing - we had shrimp and biscuit for appetizer with a delicious romaine salad, then filet mignon. The bread was to die for, the ambiance, and service were excellent...why not 5? \n",
      "\n",
      "My steak was overcooked...I ordered medium, it was well...and this is a steak house. However, everything else was very well prepared and delicious. I will give them another try my next time in vegas!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] It's so sad that what made this place so memorable was that it was so mediocre... and that my travel buddy and I got into a heated discussion while trying to decide who's \"fault\" it was that we ended up there. We finally remembered how it happened - we were at the Palazzo and she wanted steak. I wanted to stop at Cut, but she wasn't a big fan of Wolfgang Puck. She likes Mario Batali, so we glanced over Enoteca's menu, but of course - they didn't have steak. If we'd known of the existence of Carnevino, we probably would've ended up there. I don't know if the steak would've been better..... but anyway, this is about Delmonico. \n",
      "\n",
      "By the time we ended up in front of Delmonico's Steakhouse, we really were famished. It's Emeril's steakhouse - couldn't possibly be awful.............\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered:\n",
      "* A BOTTLE OF RED\n",
      "* JUMBO LUMP CRAB CAKE\n",
      "         - [4/5 - Good crab cakes - not the best, but definitely took first place over everything else we had.]\n",
      "* GRILLED FILET MIGNON MEDALLIONS\n",
      "         - [3/5 - It was alright. Average in flavor, not tender.]\n",
      "* FILET MIGNON\n",
      "         - [2/5 - She's a huge steak fan but first, they overcooked her steak - then sent her a second steak, which was still not much better and a little chewy.]\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] When I think Delmonico, I think banana cream pie rather than steak. I don't really understand applying cajun rub to a perfectly decent, medium rare porterhouse cut. But I do understand a buttery crust filled with sweet, vanilla-banana pudding and stuffed full of ripe pieces of banana. The pie isn't as creamy as the yummy banana cream pie from Jongewaard's, but I think that may be because the banana to pudding ratio favors the bananas. Delmonico has one of my favorite banana cream pies and, now, is a regular stop during my visits to Vegas. Only 3 stars though because it's a self-proclaimed \"steakhouse\" and I didn't care for the steak.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Previous to this review, I thought of Delmonicos as a 5 Star Place, but there have been some changes that I really dislike. Mostly the bread. They replaced those amazing Parker House rolls with some nasty Navajo Fry Bread, it's nasty, and greasy, and I don't like it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Other than the bread f*** up, I like Delmonicos. The chateaubriand for 2 for $100 is a great deal! This is the real reason I come here. It comes with asparagus and garlic smashed potatoes. I add an order of sautéed mushrooms and am in heaven. \n",
      "\n",
      "The service and atmosphere are also top quality, but because of the rolls being gone, I am giving this place a 3 star rating until they bring them back.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] So you stake your claim on your Rib Eye eh? I ordered mine medium-rare, au poivre and it came out medium. The peppercorns added nothing, and I kept waiting for more flavor with every bite.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a group of 12 of us split into 2 6-top tables. Even though we ordered first, they got their meals before us.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sides were nothing interesting. This is just another expensive Vegas restaurant where you pay for pretentiousness.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We dined here for Restaurant Week lunch.  For $30.12, I had the heirloom tomato salad, burger and banana creme pie.  My wife had the gumbo, fish and banana creme pie.  The salad was ok, and the burger was good, a perfect medium rare.  The best was the banana creme pie.  This is not some crap you get at Marie Callender's or some other establishments, this is the best banana creme pie I have ever had.  Yes it is that good.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Slight deductions for atmosphere as we were seated in the middle of the restaurant which felt a bit sterile and uncomfortable.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] So, I've always thought Emeril was a lot of talk and no action, but I was wrong to judge without experiencing Emeril's cooking. \n",
      "\n",
      "On our first night in Vegas, we made last-minute reservations for 9:30.   The restaurant is in kind of a weird place.  It's literally in the corner of the basement.  Granted, there are restaurants next to it, it still felt like it was at the edge of the earth.   Inside is relaxed.  It's dimly lit and the ceilings are low (again, more basement feel), but overall, it's very nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were starved, so we went right to the entrees, but they were delicious.  My boyfriend, the meat-eater in the group, had the filet, which he claims is the best cut of filet he has ever had.  He says it was cooked to perfection and it was absolutely perfect.  And, he's had quite a few steaks.  I had bacon-wrapped sea bass with pesto, roasted tomatoes, and some potato goodness, that I can't remember.  I mean, in all honesty, I wasn't expecting to be impressed, so I didn't pay much attention to the intricacies of the dish.  But, it was amazing.  The fish was cooked perfectly, the flavors were a perfect compliment to each other.  It was perfect.  \n",
      "\n",
      "And, for dessert, we shared the banana cream pie, which I knew was legendary, and quite frankly, it was the only thing that disappointed me.  It was good, but I think I expected more.  Regardless...this was a great meal, and well worth every penny.\n",
      "\n",
      "5 stars for food, minus one for weird location and ambiance.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] 5 stars for our waitress. Her service was impeccable.\n",
      "\n",
      "1 star for the food. 3 of 4 dishes had to be sent back. For an upscale restaurant that's unacceptable.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I'd say it's probably the best steakhouse i ever had!  Though it doesn't come with a view (like most of the nice restaurants in Vegas), but the settings, decorations alone are very nice.  A romantic get-away with very very nice food - from the perfectly seasoned steaks, their special steak sauces, each one of its side dishes, even the bread (the butter! yum!)...\n",
      "\n",
      "They have its own wine celler, and their wine list is prob. the best I see in LV.  Been there a couple times and will definitely go back again - when I have a little extra cash... :)\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Came on a Tuesday night there were no line and lots of empty tables.  Service was good 4-5 people cater us the whole night.  I love the bone in ribeye medium rare,  and the fried chips are a must but make sure have them make it with no salt, the cheese flakes they put on top is already salty. Price is high since its inside casino thats the only reason I gave one less than perfect.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] TL;DR: Decent steakhouse that matches its price tag; what you might expect in 5 star Vegas hotels. Not a bad option if you have $60 to drop on steak. \n",
      "\n",
      "While this steakhouse might not be anything noteworthy apart from the celebrity status of its owner, Emeril Lagasse, it serves solid food for an albeit expensive price. To be fair, though, we need to recognize that it is located in a 5-star hotel on the Las Vegas strip, one of the most tourist-saturated areas on Earth, where you can expect to be overcharged for everything. That being said, this steakhouse does what every steakhouse should to a fair standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service here is as good as you would expect at a fancy steakhouse. The free bread here is unusual, though; it seems to be a hollow roll formed by a shell of Pillsbury croissant dough, which isn't bad, but isn't especially good either. USDA Prime steaks go for around $50-$60, and are enough to feed 2 people, or one really hungry person. I ordered the steaks medium-rare, and they were cooked to order, maybe a hair closer to a medium. The steaks had a good charred crust, a mark of a good steak and something difficult to achieve at home. They offer two complimentary steak sauces, both of which pair well with the steak. I'm personally a fan of ribeye steaks and recommend that cut above anything else at a steakhouse like this one. Sides are typical, and the asparagus was nothing special but good as it was. \n",
      "\n",
      "While Emeril may never have set foot in this steakhouse, it certainly does not disappoint. While it may not be as great as some of the most famous steakhouse in NYC, Delmonico does a good job at serving beef in the middle of a touristy destination. While it probably isn't worth more than the effort of a short walk to get to, if you're staying at the Palazzo or Venetian and are looking for a fancy steak dinner, this restaurant is a solid option.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Disappointing. I was not pleased with my steak, and I was very cordial about it. The person who I told just said \"ok\" and walked away. I expected someone to come over and listen to my concerns, but no one ever did. They also did not discount or remove it from my check.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are far better steakhouses in Las Vegas.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I had expected this Emeril restaurant to be MUCH better than Mortons or Ruth Chris.  Very disappointed as it was just on par.\n",
      "Having tried dozens of steak houses, this was clearly NOT a good performer.  If this is your first time, or have a taste bud for Dennys, this is your gig.\n",
      "\n",
      "The $57 bone-in rib eye I had was so not tender, cooked raw, just poor when compared to the other non-celebrity famous steak houses (i.e. Metropolitan in Seattle).\n",
      "\n",
      "The waitor forgot 1/2 my requests, and it was clearly priced as a tourist trap.  Nothing like Emeril restaurant in New Orleans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Should have known that this be a tourist trap :(\n",
      "\n",
      "Its too bad, as I really like Emeril and think brings down the name brand he has built up in the past.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This was a great venue to have some dinner and enjoy the company of friends.  Located in restaurant row in the Venetian, this place is an Emeril restaurant that features steaks and sides of high quality.  \n",
      "\n",
      "A few of my party actually shared the rib eye because it was a really bit cut of meat.  That combined with the great sides made a wonderful meal.  Service was impeccable as our waiter and other staff were engaged and always on top of what we needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "For sides, I'd suggest the grits and bacon.  I ate the whole side dish and barely shared with others.  The creamed corn was surprisingly good and the brussels were also really good.  For dessert, we had the strawberry shortcake which came in a jar which was terribly good.  We also had the chocolate cake and key lime pie.  I didn't try too much of that as I was stuck digging my spoon in the strawberry shortcake. \n",
      "\n",
      "For a great balance of food and service, I highly recommend.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Our foodie friend Chung recommended us to this wonderful place. \n",
      "\n",
      "This place is dark, it felt like eating in a rustic wine cellar. \n",
      "The waiters are friendly.\n",
      "I ordered Bone in New York strip and Mr.Q ordered himself  Bone in rib eye.\n",
      "The presentation of the steak looks poor, when I saw the giant portion of sizzling steak was drowning in the oil and come out in a hot plate.  I told myself \" that couldn't be good\". It made me changed my mind immediately after I took my first bite. It was juicy, meaty, tasty, tender and much much more. Wow! Amazingly tasty! The quality of the steak is really good. \n",
      "The steak is d*mn good, but huge. I left half of it. What a waste of such beautiful piece, I wish I could bear a spandex tummy instead of wear spandex dress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you Chung for the wonderful recommendation and a wonderful happy tummy evening for me and Mr.Q.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] i come here every time i visit vegas. the bone-in ribeye is solid, i usually eat at the bar by myself, servers are friendly and attentive without being intrusive.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] One of best steaks I've had. Definitely a solid 4.5 even better, I dined on lobster bisque, a bone in ribeye  steak w/ smashed potatoes, sauted mushrooms and creamed spinach. \n",
      "\n",
      "My steak was was cooked to perfection, juicy throughout. not to mention the little things such as the pat of compound butter that added that punch. The lobster bisque was smooth and rich. The sides we're all great as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "The pricing was fair, it is a la carte steakhouse after all thats what you come to expect at an establishment like this. Service was just right, very attentive but at the same time the wait staff wasnt breathing down our neck. Loved my experience here, hopefully we will back again soon!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I had fillet, it was wonderful.  Great service, nice atmosphere.  The sides were pretty good, especially wild mushrooms:) The chef overcooked my BF's steak, so they quickly offered him a substitute.  Great wine list:) Enjoy!!!!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Bone-in ribeye was the bomb.\n",
      "\n",
      "They cook the steaks as precise as you could get for medium and medium rare lovers out there.  No need to temperature down when being asked in anticipation of the kitchen cooking the crap out of your steak, what you ask for is what you get.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was here was some buddies for a random Vegas trip and we decided to do it big at Delmonico.  The experience was great.  The ambiance is a little bit more on the \"date night\" side of the spectrum, but the service is awesome and the steaks and sides are delicious.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Make reservations and don't stress about the price, it's a special occasion.  Even if it's not a special occasion, it will be when you steak comes at exactly the right temperature.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I got the 3 course special, it was amazing. The Tomato soap was the best I've ever had, then I got the tenderloin medallions so good, followed by the pecan pie also very good. The wait staff was great too with good recommendations. I would recommend this place to anyone.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Solid.  Still serving up all the flavor, fat, and syrupy opulence one expects from the Emeril Lagasse empire.  Oh, it happens to serve some great steaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lunch is straight forward.  Salads, gumbo, and an INCREDIBLE STEAK SANDWICH.  A juicy skirt steak is topped with loads of roasted mushrooms, onions, wilted spinach and a pungent horseradish mayo on a warm ciabatta roll with a side of crispy truffle fries.  A great deal for under $20.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dinner brings out the best.  For starters its hard to pass on the truffle parm potato chips (you weren't expecting that huh).  Crispy, earthy, just good eats and so perfect with any cocktail or wine.  The roasted heirloom tomato soup with  grilled ricotta cheese sandwich, creamy and acidic, comforting goodness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The steaks are all great quality USDA prime.  Well trimmed and dry aged on site.  Unfortunately, the selection of cuts is limited.   The bone in strip, dense beefy goodness and stands up well to the Creole seasoning (used on all their steaks).  Dry aged steak purist will balk at its use as it destroys the umame goodness.  The bone in rib is more tender and makes the perfect base for \"Oscar\" style prep (topped with a generous heaping of jumbo lump crab meat, asparagus, and a very rich and tangy béarnaise that blends perfectly with the creole seasoning). Win!\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not all about the steaks.  The apple smoked kurobuta ham chop with grits and cider reduction is outstanding.  Pure simplicity.  Natural, tender ham packing  deep \"hammy\" flavor whose richness and saltiness is balanced perfectly by the acidity and sweetness of hard cider reduction.  Holiday ham on steroids!\n",
      "\n",
      "Friendly and efficient service.\n",

      "BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! (Four stars; yeah I couldn't resist).\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Prior to our trip, a few of us wanted to do a steak dinner in Vegas and we agreed on Delmonicos. Delving into the menu so I had an idea in mind of what I would be ordering, I became intrigued immensely when I saw that it was under Emeril's.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were fortunate to be seated a little early. The ambiance of course evokes an intimate and formal setting with the dim lighting. The decor was minimal and I felt there could have used some art pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me say the service was top-notch. Although it is what you'd expect from such an establishment, very few places achieve such high marks IMO.\n",
      "The water glasses were never empty and it felt like we didn't really have a server but a rotation of different people that comprised the waitstaff. I counted at least 6 different people between taking our order, serving the appetizers, the main course, side dishes, wine, filling the waters and dessert. \n",
      "\n",
      "Appetizer: Ahi Tuna & Salmon Tartare: Superb. I liked how the cucumber salad complemented the tuna & salmon and came in a spiraled form. The wonton chips were crispy and a nice form used for stacking the tartare & salad on. The wasabi provided a nice bite and offered a different note with the tartare. \n",
      "\n",
      "Main Course: Ribeye (no-bone). Some say the meat tastes better on the bone. In this case I found the Ribeye to be succulent, juicy well seasoned and cooked to perfection. Frankly I don't think it would have made much of difference if it was on the bone or not based on the flavor. Adding on the butter on top was a nice feature to the steak. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sides: All the sides were delicious and was about the right amount to share for 3 (4 if the people aren't big eaters. \n",
      "\n",
      "Potato Gratin: So good I couldn't stop eating it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Creamed Spinach: No joke and the right balance of cream to tone down the strong taste of spinach was harmonic. \n",
      "\n",
      "Asparagus: I'm not an asparagus fan but if asparagus always tasted this good, it might crack my top 3 favorite vegetables. Had the right amount of salt and seasoning to create a more palatable asparagus. \n",
      "\n",
      "Dessert: Sorbet; 3 scoops, 3 flavors. Strawberry, Banana and the 3rd resembled Coconut. I found the sorbet to be a more suitable and lighter offering vs. if it was an ice cream or gelato.\n",
      "Clean flavors and the banana was surprisingly interesting given the fact its not something one often comes across.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Went there for my father's 80th birthday.  Excellent.  My parents both ordered the fillet mignon, which was very flavorful.  The butter on top helps.  I got the fillet medallions.  I found the sauce and crust to be slightly too overpowering on the fillet, but it was still very good.  Our waiter, Frank, was very personable and made us feel right at home.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The misleading reviews that others wrote about this place have almost made me lose all faith in Yelp.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, this place is NOT worth your money. No. No. No.  Let's recap why.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was hit or miss. When we got there a few minutes early for a reservation, I let them know we would wait for a good table. Instead, the hostess tried to sit us at a table next to a portable cooking station and this little room where the waiters get extra plates, forks, etc. Worst seat in the house. No joke. It was after 10 p.m. on a Friday. The place WAS packed, but there were a few better tables left. Why do us like this?\n",
      "\n",
      "So we ask for a better table. Hostess walks us all the way back out of the dining room, looks at computer, walks us all the way back into dining room, this time to sit us near the open backdoor that patrons use to go to the bathroom and the waitstaff uses to hide in in between orders. It's January. So clearly this is a great idea. NOT.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was so angry I almost walked out right then. I could understand if it was 8 p.m. and those free, better tables were being saved for someone. But it was late. We were the last customers of the night. Give us the best, free table, you idiot!\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyhizzle, our waiter shows up and man is amazing. He reads us the whole menu, which usually I hate, but he was so charming, it was OK.  Loved him. Best part of the entire night.\n",
      "\n",
      "So they start us with a complimentary  amuse-bouche, which was declicious. So second best part of the night. And that basically concludes are positives.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bread was so boring I thought it was running for office. \n",
      "\n",
      "My wine tasted as if the bottle had been opened the week before. When I complained ONLY because I was asked if I liked it, the amazing waiter brought me two other wines to try. Im telling you, best waiter ever. But the wines all tasted rancid. I didn't tell him this because I didn't want to be a jerk, so I just sipped happily cuz it is Vegas and the point is to drink, OK?\n",
      "\n",
      "We started with the lobster bisque (I've tasted better lobster broth at Whole Foods and the lobster was hard) and a mushy tomato salad.\n",
      "\n",
      " Then we shared some crazy 32-ounce ribeye that came with a puff pastry and bone marrow. I love marrow, but this was gross. And the ribeye had no taste at all. No salt. No pepper. Just grease. Where's the BAM, Emeril? Also, the steak was so hard and not medium rare, as we ordered it. \n",
      "\n",
      "The waiter recommended the potatoes gratin. Dude, I've made better gratin drunk. The potatoes were still hard and it tasted like pure garlic. I love garlic, but this was like Buffy the Vampire Slayer killing a villian garlic. \n",
      "\n",
      "So we left. The check wasn't bad for Vegas. \n",
      "\n",
      "But for a special night out? Not worth your time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like StripSteak at Mandalay so much more. While it does have THE shittiest service, the steaks are like butter and the sides are to die for.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Delicious gumbo, chateaubriand, asparagus, and the most amazing mashed potatoes!  I thought the chateaubriand was a good value at $105 for two people, as it came with sides and was cooked to order at our table.  The wine was good, the service was great, all of the staff was friendly.  I think my favorite part was the warm dinner rolls.  I loved their wine list too.  I will definitely eat here next time I'm staying at the Venetian.\n",

      "\n",
      "We had the BBQ Shrimp as an appetizer, shared a salad, he had the rib eye steak and I the Filet Mignon. both of the steaks melted in our mouths. I have never had a steak do that, and I have had a lot of steaks in my time. We had the Country Smashed Potatoes and steamed asparagus as sides. The Steamed asparagus was nothing new, but the potatoes... oh my, they were good. they were like au gratin potatoes with mozzarella cheese. yummo. \n",

      "By the time we were done with all of that, sadly, we did not have room for dessert, but that didn't leave us leaving unhappy... it was quite a lovely experience.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] ordered ribeye bone.  it was excellent!  juicy, tasty.  now, i'm not sure if it's because of the type (with the bone), or the butter they put on top of it.  bread.. they only provided one kind and it was mediocre.  wine was good (based on their recommendation).\n",
      "\n",
      "giving only 4 star because of the bread and the service.  they only provided one kind and even so it was just so-so.  would've been nice for them to invest a bit more in it, as a nice complement before the steak arrive.\n",
      "secondly, the service.  was not as good as wolfgang puck's the cut.  but since i care more about the food, i still give delmonico the trophy over the cut.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I have been taken here begrudgingly a few times now and have left with the same sensation of being overstuffed with average meat or poultry and starch.  The restaurant itself is not aesthetically appealing(drab lighting with white painted walls) and seating is not very private as the proximity of the tables are annoying.  I think the branding by Emeril has had a national appeal that people identify with and that's how his restaurants do so well but personally, I think all of his restaurant's food is mediocre at best with the exception of Commander's Palace in New Orleans.  Now don't get me totally wrong, the food isn't terrible as I still give this 3 stars but the whole experience here just won't knock your socks off.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] After reading other bad reviews I realized we are not the only ones whom this happened too. First we were charged double for the wine yes that's right a so called liquor tax that was exactly double the price\n",
      " \n",
      "Second I noticed throughout the meal and going to the restrooms that this place is racist they put any group with colored people in this one room and white people out in the open I think another table noticed this as well. I'm clearly disgusted and won't be dinning at affiliated restaurants\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Five stars for the Banana Cream Pie! It's really really good! We decided buying one every time we come! This is the top one dessert for me right now! As good as mastro's butter cake!\n",

      "\n",
      "Dennis gave me a list of tempting options for lunch. I had to watch how much I was going to have for lunch as I had a dinner reservation at Raku that evening for the kaiseki menu but the lobster sliders at Delmonico caught my eye, so that was my choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a nice time wandering through the Venetian on my way to Delmonico. The size and scale of U.S. buildings in general amaze me but the Venetian is certainly very ornate and I enjoyed looking at the menus while walking down restaurant row on the way to Delmonico\n",
      "\n",
      "I instantly recognised Dennis from his Yelp picture and like all the Yelpers I've met, conversation flowed like we were old friends. So much so that unusually for Yelpers, we were chatting so much that ordering took awhile as we hadn't look at the menu the first few times that our waiter approached to take our order\n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant is certainly decked out to appeal to the higher end of customer. It was a quiet lunch service when we dined and while it provided a good ambiance for chatting, I perhaps didn't see Delmonico as the busy celebrity chef steakhouse that it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had already decided on my main course of lobster sliders and using my personal rule of taking the opportunity of eating foods that I don't come across often, I paired that with an appetiser of traditional New Orleans gumbo. I'm not in any position to comment on the authenticity of the gumbo but as Emeril Lagasse started his celebrated celebrity chef trail with his first restaurant Emeril's in New Orleans, I'm guessing he can cook a good gumbo. Mine was certainly pungent with a great depth of flavour from a carefully stock. Being Asian, I was also impressed to see that the rice had been cooked well\n",

      "Dennis was pleased with his appetiser of lobster bisque followed by Caesar salad\n",
      "\n",
      "It may seem odd to eschew steak at a steakhouse. However, I've always liked the sound of lobster roll but still haven't tried one yet. I saw these lobster sliders as the nearest I could get until I make my trip to the northeast to try a real lobster roll. Well, the sliders were excellent - soft rolls containing morsels of sweet lobster meat mixed with the right amount of mayonnaise and seafood dressing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dennis however wasn't quite as lucky with his fillet steak, which arrived looking rather lonely on the plate. Dennis decided to order some bearnaise to correct this loneliness but it took a long time to appear and when it did, it seemed a bit watery.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an effort to not be too piggy, Dennis and I split the banana cream pie. Well, the combination of banana, pie, whipped cream, caramel and chocolate shavings pleased my palate probably more than my arteries! I don't have a really sweet tooth but I really enjoyed this\n",

      "First, even though we had a reservation, they had us wait for 20 min in the lounge. Fine, we had some drinks. My cosmopolitan was not impressive at all: I had two sips and didn't finish the rest. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the food itself. Good news is, everything came very fast. Bad news is, it tasted OK but not great: steak was either too chewy or had too much spice (and we had the famed bone-in ribeye and a chateaubriand (spelling?)), truffled chips were fried very brown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tableware was uninspired, especially the tea cups got to me: I think I've seen better ones at a Motel 6 for breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last, the service. Overall it was OK, but then, when I was in the middle of a story, the waiter comes to ask how we are doing and goes on for 10 minutes about this and that and how the convention is different this year, etc. Really? By the time he is done, nobody remembers what we were talking about, and I am MAD.\n",

However as soon as Michael saw that it was not cooked properly he immediately took it back and had it cooked completely. I would have not gotten a steak like that we'll-done but he's picky. When he got it back he said it was a very good steak, just wished there was more steak and less bone. \n",

If you are looking for a great steak and a wonderful, special dining experience, visit Delmonicos\n",

I ordered the half roasted duck (yeah i know it's still meat but it's not red meat...get off my back) and my wife had the halibut.

      "We started with an heirloom tomato salad which was quite good.  Truffle and parm chips were delicious as well and certainly something I've looked to duplicate at home.  Buffalo ribeye was a good change of pace as well from the typical Texas steak house offerings.  Really enjoyed the wine reduction with that.  Also sampled the filet which was pretty standard, well done however.\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The BEST steakhouse ever. The perfect amount of seasoning/flavor and a nice huge cut of perfectly cooked bone-in ribeye earns this establishment a 5 from me. every time I eat at a different steakhouse I always compare it to Delmonico's. Some other steakhouses in LV might hold a higher rating from \"professional reviewers\", but seriously, they don't hold a candle to this joint.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The best service I had was here during my time in Las Vegas. The al a cart sides were large enough to share family style.

Everything from the first glass of water to the banana cream pie titillated our taste buds! The filet mignon was glazed and cooked to perfection. The sautéed mushrooms were bomb. I couldn't have asked for a better meal!\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the service was fantastic. The guidance from our server was honest and perfect and our wine and water glasses never dipped below half full!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My husband and I went there for lunch on a Saturday. We had a physically exhausting week so we decided to treat ourselves. But it hasn't always been easy for our allergy whenever we ate out. So we called Delmonico ahead to see if they can accommodate our special needs. The lady who answered our call was very courteous and we felt comfortable to try after having some answers from her.\n",
      "As we arrived, the restaurant has a comfortable ambience. I wouldn't say it is grand or special but just comfortable. When it was time to order, the server was courteous regarding our allergy too and I believe the one who took care of us was a manager. He even checked with the chef to make sure the complimentary popover was okay for us to consume. We told them we are allergic to soy, corn, peanut, tomato and pork products, and some other stuff, and he had been very mindful and advised accordingly as we ordered, he did it so graciously that we didn't feel being put in a spot. Some other semi high end restaurants had given us a startled face or even an uncomfortable face when we mentioned our allergy, but this manager was super professional that he didn't make us feel crappy about our differences from others. So he made a potential stressful situation easy for us, very impressive.\n",
      "Their steak was aged in house by the restaurant and we think their aging was done fabulously as there was no rotten smell or taste in it. The manager even double checked with us and informed us that the beef was sourced from corn fed cows and asked if we would be able to tolerate that. And we made our decision to say yes and went ahead with the steak. Their steaks were very delicious. We actually asked for medium well with no seasoning and the steak still came out super delicious and juicy. So the good quality is in the steak itself and didn't need to depend on seasoning or being served bloodily. Again, very impressive.\n",
      "Anyway, it was a delicious meal and we were well taken care of so we didn't get sick from any event of undisclosed allergens. We are very happy with this meal. We would go back when we have another time wanting to treat ourselves again. Hopefully the manager will be there again the next time we visit.\n",

The duck was rich but was cooked right. It's extremely hard to cook good duck, but they nailed it! Then I got the filet minion, medium rare. It melted in my mouth. It was amazing. It may have been more on the rare side, but I had no complaints. To finish off my experience I got the bread pudding. Just like the filet, amazing. The pecan buttered ice cream and the warm bread was bigger than it looked - but had no problem finishing it. In our group of 3, we each got a different menu item - I feel like what i got trumped the other dishes. Try it!\n",

We both ordered that except I got mines with foie gras since I miss it sooo much (california ban no bueno). I understand how fattening it is, especially with a steak, but its Vegas and she looked so effing hot and I told myself, NIKE! (just do it!) I got mines medium rare like the pros and it came out just as I had hoped - not overcooked, although there were small parts where I questioned if it was too rare for me! I mean my whole mentality that night before we met up with my friends at Hakkasan ft. Calvin Harris was #yolo! so I figured it WHY NOT? To my very surprise, I managed to finish ~85% of the huge piece of steak, which was quite an accomplishment for myself.

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] On our first night's stay at The Venetian, we walked to Delmonico in less than 5 minutes and were seated on time.  It took approximately 60 seconds for the staff to begin delivering The Bliss.  I am not a steakhouse fan (my husband is), but this restaurant is an Emeril restaurant, and having had wonderful experiences at his other establishments in New Orleans, I thought we would be in for a treat.  The service was extraordinary even though the restaurant was hustling at by 8 p.m., we had the full attention of our waiter as well as the sommelier and other ancillary staff, which made the evening a lot of fun.  We enjoyed an amuse bouche of heirloom tomatoes, basil, burrata cheese and EVOO.  My husband ended up with an enormous piece of meat on his plate (no surprise there) that he stated emphatically was the best steak he'd ever had, accompanied by a terrine-sized dish of the New Orleans Creamed Spinach, easily the best creamed spinach I've ever put in my mouth.  I only wish I had been able to enjoy the leftovers in an omelette the next day for breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered one of the specials, which was a $42 plate of pasta.  Yes, you read right: a $42 plate of pasta.  It was heaven: just the right amount of papparadelle with six very large shrimp, and a generous amount of andouille sausage and artichoke hearts.  I enjoyed a complementary glass of red wine that was a blend of several varietals; complex and nicely balanced, it was a wine that Emeril endorsed and labeled, and it had been bottled by Au Bon Climat Winery in Santa Barbara, CA.  I started with the mixed greens salad, dressed with a sherry vinaigrette and shaved Manchego cheese.  It was perfectly balanced and just the right flavor profile for my mood that night.  We were too full for dessert, but had there been room, my money would have been on Emeril's Banana Cream Pie, served with caramel sauce, chocolate shavings and whipped cream. I didn't take pictures at Delmonico, but we enjoyed our food immensely and I would return in a heartbeat.  The staff is well-trained and extremely attentive, and the food is unpretentious, well-prepared and top-drawer.\n",

Then once someone was at the front desk, she totally ignored my existence and we stood there for another ten minutes.

This was apparent after she ordered it \"medium well\" and I shot her a look and remark of \"I don't want mine medium well, I want it medium rare\" This minor conflict turned uncomfortable for the rest of my family as her and I debated over how our steak should be cooked. (My theory - anything over medium kills the good juicy flavor) All the while the waitress was standing there, listening to us go back and forth about the steak. I don't remember how it ended up being cooked, but I do remember the steak coming out cut in half. Thanks waitress. \n",

We then ordered the popular bbq shrimp as an appetizer along with the lobster bisque.  The shrimp dish consisted of 4 very flavorful large prawns and  the bisque was TO DIE FOR.   Now on to the meat... it was cooked to perfection, a red warm center.  Definitely one of best steaks I have ever had, hands down.    As we wrapped up the dinner, the waiter brought out a complimentary dessert of chocolate sorbet over a waffle flat bread.  The service was impeccable.

For our table side Caesar salad meant for two guests, they stretched it for the three of us. The times between our bbq shrimp appetizer, plump and flavorful, the salad, and our meats were appropriate. My rack of lamb (med-rare) was cooked to perfection, juicy and tasty. My parents' filet mignon (med) were just as tasty with a generous serving of butter on top. The dessert of carrot cake did not disappoint. The huge cake (definitely recommend sharing) was delicious.

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Great service! Excellent menu! Their chateaubriand steak was mouth-watering!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I blame my father for my inordinate love of all things gourmet. Thankfully, I appreciate a good burrito as much as I appreciate a good steak, but I will definitely seize every opportunity to dine in style as much as I can.\n",

      "Thanks to a family trip to Vegas, I got to eat at Emeril's, once more partaking our family's favorite pasttime: eating. We had eaten at the original location in New Orleans when I lived there, and it was one of my top 5 dining experiences of all time. This one definitely tied that experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "As other people have said, if you're not going to eat steak in some form when you come here, you're wasting your time. The steak is truly a peak experience for meat lovers. We all ate our  steaks in silence, save for the \"OMG!\" and \"MMMM!\" and \"wow.wow.wow.\"  They all had the filet mignon, and I had the bone-in dry aged ribeye: the best steak I have ever eaten in my life. It came on a bed of perfectly creamy garlic mashed potatoes and foie gras butter just melting into it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Have you ever had lightly tempura battered asparagus? It's worth coming here just to try them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Even the sides- delicious spinach he made without cream that was STILL good (shocking, I know), and broccoli cooked to perfection...we all kept remarking how absolutely everything was just perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other thing that distinguishes restaurants like this is the service.  Places like this are in a whole other league- waiters who seem to read your mind, appearing and disappearing before you even realized you needed something - never interrupting conversation, never hovering, always classy and helpful. Our waiter chose the perfect wine for us with with the vague descriptions of what we were looking for, and it truly was the best complement to our meals ever. \n",
      "\n",
      "The design of the room is also a refreshing breath of fresh air from all the gaudy glitz and obnoxious 'bigness' of Vegas; simple, clean lines and understated elegance and chairs that make it seem like your table is totally self-contained and isolated from the other tables. Great to have that feeling of privacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "We lingered for hours just basking in the glow of such perfection and decadence.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I had dinner there last night with a friend and my wife. The service was flawless, courteous and diligent. The appetizers were great, the octopus and the truffle potato chips, highly recommended. The bone-in Ribeye was cooked perfectly. \n",
      "I will have to go back to try other things in the menu. My friend had spent most of the afternoon thinking about a good Ribeye.  Delmonico served him what he wanted and he was blown away...\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Best house rib eye steak I have ever had.  The service is excellent.  Absolutely will come here again!!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Back to Delmonico three more times for great Louisiana Caviar atop sumptuous Deviled Eggs; light and airy Popovers; mellow Lobster Bisque; traditional black New Orleans Gumbo; fine French Onion Soup; Caesar Salad prepared tableside; buttery medium rare Creekstone Prime Grade Filet Mignon paired with perfectly seasoned Duck Fat Fingerling Potatoes; a nice mix of Garlic Sauteed Mushrooms; coffee prepared with Jamaican coffee beans; amazingly delicious Emeril's Banana Cream Pie with Caramel Sauce, Chocolate Shavings, and Whipped Cream; very memorable Pecan Pie with Oatmeal Shortbread Crust, Vanilla Ice Cream, and Caramel Sauce; and most recently for lunch during Restaurant Week a humongous 15-ounce Prime Grade medium rare Bacon Cheeseburger on a Sesame-Seeded Brioche Bun dressed with tomato slices, lettuce, White Onions, ketchup, and mayo topped by a juicy pickle segment accompanied by very tasty homemade lightly browned French Fries glistening with a sheen of Duck Fat.  \n",

      "Once Diane did not receive her Maitre-D Butter, and her steak arrived with some char and pepper after her specific request not to.  But otherwise food preparation and service were impeccable and working in tandem like a well-oiled machine.  When an apparent miscommunication resulted in receipt of Sauteed Spinach instead of Creamed Spinach, a side of Creamed Spinach was voluntarily and quickly brought to the table as well, without charge.  Both dishes were outstanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Restaurant Week lunch culminated in a fine finish with a rich Banana Cream Pie Parfait with Caramel Sauce, Chocolate Shavings, Whipped Cream and Graham Crumbs for me; and traditional Bread Pudding with lip-smacking warm Caramel Pecan Sauce for Diane.  For us, based on past experiences, there is every reason to return again for more epicurean delights.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Don't get me wrong by the lack of a fifth star, I really, really loved dining at Delmonico's.  I thought the service was extremely attentive (truly some of the best service I have had) and food was great.  I would definitely return and I am sure we would have another wonderful dining experience.  However, I have had better steaks so I cannot rank this as the best of the best.  On the other hand, this is one of the best restaurants I have been to in Vegas and would definitely give it two thumbs up and recommend it to those staying at the Venetian.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Been here several times. This is definitely our go to place in Vegas. Awesome service! Steaks are the best I've had. We like to try different places but we always have to go to Delmonico while in Vegas.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Best place for a killer steak in the venetian. Always on my top list when visiting or dining with friends/clients.  Amazing food, amazing service. Wish we had more stars, I'd still give it 100%\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Love their cream corn & BBQ shrimp! Service was top-notch, friendly and attentive. You can split the bone-in rib eye if you plan on ordering appetizers, sides & dessert, plenty of food for two! The only thing was, it was a little hard to locate inside The Venetian.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] How does one spell grossly overrated...Delmonico's!!! First, I have seen more originality in a Denny's restaurant in terms of decor. This place is as boring to the eye as watching paint dry...that should have been my clue to exit right!!! There is no color, no cool lighting, no cool art, no great looking floors...nope, a two year old could have designed a more interesting restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let's talk food. It is 3am and I'm on the toilet, let's start there!!! They hand me a steak they claim is prime beef. The only thing prime was the price...52 bucks! The meat was not only tough, but like the decor, it had no taste...NONE. Cosco has better steaks then that thing they brought me. \n",
      "\n",
      "So they do take it back a I ordered rack of lamb for, yes, 55 bucks!!! Now those little four rib racks were excellent...but not 55 bucks worth of excellence.  Where's the MEAT! \n",
      "\n",
      "Then it is time to go to the bathroom...you won't believe it...a dirty, filthy two stall bathroom!!! And the road to the bathroom, and I purposely used the word road, was a journey in itself. How is it that a place that charges 55 bucks for a rack of lamb can have such a piece of s@&t bathroom? \n",
      "\n",
      "And as I sit here on the toilet at 3am all I can tell you is if you think this place is great, then you are from Hoboken NJ because this is a grossly over rated restaurant with horrible food, decor, bathrooms, etc. the owner is laughing to the bank with the fools who go here...AVOID this place. \n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant manage reached out to me...good for them...but I'm not interested.  You get ONE chance to make your reputation, and Mr. Celebrity Chef, you lost it here.  AWFUL PLACE!  GROSSLY OVER PRICED!  DON'T WAIST TIME OR MONEY HERE!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Outstanding Restaurant \n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My boyfriend and I stop in here for dinner quite often while in Las Vegas. Chateaubriand w/ asparagus and au-gratin potatoes is on hit! Incredible wine list and their wait staff is extremely friendly. They don't have late hours like other restaurants, I think they close around 10 or 11pm (which is way early) but still a good place to check out.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Had dinner on 6/26/13. This was the second time my wife and I dined at Delmonico Steakhouse. The 1st time I ordered the bone-in-ribeye and was disappointed because it had some gristle and was underwhelming to say the least. On this trip, the wife had the organic baby mixed greens salad and the Filet while I had the shrimp cocktail and once again the bone-in-ribeye. We also shared an order of asparagus.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Filet was good - tender and nicely seasoned. My ribeye was disappointing, however. It was not very tender and didn't have much flavor for being dry-aged 2-3 weeks as per our waiter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service and atmosphere are on par with most of the other high-end steakhouses in Vegas, but the steaks are not as good as those we have had at Craftsteak, Cut, N9ne, Stripsteak, Prime, or even STK. Does not deserve more than 3 stars IMO and even though it wasn't bad, it is not good enough for us to return especially with all the other choices in town.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] From being a staple and a visit every single time, lately the visits to Delmonicos have been less than fantastic. \n",
      "\n",
      "The filet minion which they used to do perfectly and second to none now usually comes out either overcooked or undercooked. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Caesar salad we loved is now a 50/50 shot. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally and most disappointing is the $130 seafood tower which is probably the least value I've ever seen. Lobster tails where the meat sticks to the shell and a tuna cup which was really bad. \n",
      "\n",
      "They still make the best vanilla ice cream. That's something. :)\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I came for a restaurant week lunch with my two lovelies, Sandra and David and my husband joined before he headed to work. This 3 course was $30.15.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 3 of us not working that day ordered beverages. This place made my heart sing because they had a Whisky BOOK. To be handed pages upon pages to browse on top of the other spirits, wine menu AND cocktail menus made my damn head spin because I wanted a lot of things. I settled on getting the Scarlet Starlet which had Glenmorangie 10, Tuaca, lime, hibiscus, strawberry and egg whites. It was totally up my alley - very much the scotch shined then the balance of the rest of the ingredients came through. Very much worth the $16 in alcohol and skill in mixing- the bartender Michelle was great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Appetizer I got VINE-RIPENED HEIRLOOM TOMATO SALAD (With Burrata Cheese, Red onion, Balsamic Vinegar and Torn Local Basil) which was standard, but good because the components were quality and fresh. \n",
      "\n",
      "Entree I got PAN ROASTED ATLANTIC SALMON( With Sweet Corn & Crab Vinaigrette and Fresh Basil) which was nicely cooked and was very fresh and clean. I liked the large pieces of lump crab mixed in with the corn. \n",
      "\n",
      "Dessert the hubby and I shared:\n",
      "\n",
      "BANANA CREAM PIE PARFAIT(Caramel Sauce, Chocolate Shavings, Whipped Cream and Graham Crumbs) was a solid dessert that could convince someone who doesnt like banana cream. The custard in it was creamy while still being light. \n",
      "\n",
      "TRADITIONAL BREAD PUDDING(With Warm Caramel Pecan Sauce) I love bread pudding and this was good, but average. I do appreciate that the caramel was flavorful while not being saccharine sweet.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought it was a solid lunch, but I am coming back for drinks as there's very few places on the strip I've enjoyed the beverage offerings as this. Fantastic beverage program for the libation lover.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Really enjoyed this meal, after having a bad meal and service at a restaurant the night before (am doing that review next).  The service was amazing.  Our waiter never said no to ANY request.  He was phenomenal. I sure wish I could remember his name so he could get his proper kudos. The night was June 24 and party was in Gignac's name.  The steaks were cooked perfectly, his recommendations were right on point. I had the ribeye, without bone.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Delmonico Steakhouse is a steakhouse owned by Emeril Lagasse, located inside the Venetian/Palazzo Hotel & Casino. They are known for steaks. \n",
      "\n",
      "We started our meal with the Seafood Tower. The Tower has lobster, shrimp, tuna, oysters, Alaskan king crab. Wow, talk about a carnival in your mouth! The Seafood is fresh and sweet.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the bone-in ribeye. It was a very large cut! It could have easily been shared. The steak comes a la carte so you have to also order side dishes. The sides are mostly vegetables as options (broccoli, scalloped potatoes, creamed spinach, asparagus, mushrooms). The steak was cooked perfectly and it was perfectly seasoned too. The sides were delicious too.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Dessert time, You must try Emeril's signature Banana Cream Pie. It is nice and light. Not sweet, light, just right. It is my most favorite dish at Emeril's restaurants! A must try!\n",
      "\n",
      "Delmonico's is pricey but delicious!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Vegas is one of the few places in the U.S. where dining inside a hotel is cool and worth the extra green. Boy, did Emeril hit all the right notes on this little gem. It's both romantic and fun, warm and cool, and definitely a little trendy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the Quayle- off the chart delicious. The three other people I was with also loved their food. The wait staff does that stealthy stalking... you know... where one second you're staring into down into an empty H2O glass and then the next- it's completely full. Overall a great experience.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Delicious- from the cocktails to the steaks! Apps: We tried the oysters and bbq shrimp (holy yum!). Entrees: Our party of 6 had all steaks (filet, ribeye and bone-in ribeye) which were all cooked to perfection. One ribeye was very fatty but that's to be expected with that cut and the portion size of the steaks is so that there was plenty to be found that was free of fat- seriously, these steaks are HUGE, definitely share-worthy. Sides: Creamed Corn (VERY yum!), Sauteed Mushrooms (yum), Mashed potatoes (how can you go wrong) and a Twice Baked Potato (a little over done on the bottom but still good regardless). We enjoyed the service and the experience overall. Would highly recommend!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This place is horribly overrated.  Service was terrible.  They act like they don't want you there.  It took 45 minutes between the first course and the main entree for the food to come out and not once did any waiter come by to check on the table.  Do not go.  Plenty of other great steakhouses in Vegas.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Ordered the bone in rib-eye and it was prepared to perfection.  The flavor was amazing. The creamed corn was very delicious as well. I like the atmosphere of the restaurant, not too stuffy.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Banana Cream Pie was to die for. I don't even like bananas. I've had dreams about that pie for two nights in a row.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grilled cheese was okay. Lobster Bisque was EXCELLENT. Server had no personality. Tomato soup was good. Burger was alright. Lobster sliders were good. French fries came out cold, so we sent them back and they were very promptly replaced with fresh, hot ones. \n",
      "\n",
      "Get the pie. Trust me.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Just okay.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I liked my meal.  I had the gumbo soup, a great baked potato with lots of fixings, a sort of chocolate cheesecake dessert that was great.  My husband didn't like his meal.  My husband ordered a $50 steak that was fatty and gristley.  I could tell he was bummed when he poked around at his steak with furrowed eyebrows, cutting off piece after piece of inedible meat.\n",
      "\n",
      "  I was really hoping to please him since it was his birthday.  I let them know when I made the reservations well in advance that it was his birthday and we didn't get a birthday dessert or anything free like you do at most other restaurants.  They remembered it was his birthday, the hostess (who was pleasant and very friendly) gave him a cheery happy birthday as we were going to be seated.  I really expect a little something special if we are spending our special day at their establishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The waitstaff was prompt and friendly.  They seemed to linger around and dive right in when you need a refill on your drink, or in my case another great martini.  I almost forgot to mention that I loved their martinis.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Will we return?  Definitely no.  There are way more better restaurants in Vegas.  The atmosphere is a big blah (with the exception of the impressive suits that the friendly waitors wear), the food was just okay/slightly better than average, and the prices higher than they should be for the quality.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The menu offered very comforting, rich Southern influenced dishes for the most part, such as seafood chowder, creamed spinach, beef chili with chive sour cream and fried rock shrimp. I chose the beef chili, which was very good, if a tad bit too salty for my taste. The portions were well-sized. The banana cream pie, drizzled with caramel sauce, was the ultimate in banana cream pies. The nice sized slice was overloaded with banana slices and dense banana cream custard, and it was complemented with a fine tender crust, whipped cream, chocolate shavings, and caramel sauce. mmmmmmm...Definitely the best banana cream pie I've ever had, and I've tried quite a few. I look forward to going back when I visit Las Vegas again and trying all the other delicious looking dishes. and their key lime pie! You just have to try the pies! Great restaurant if you like your food robust, unfussy, and rich.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Intro:\n",
      "As is the case with most (if not all) steakhouses, don't fuss with too many appetizers.  Go straight for the beef.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food:\n",
      "Chateaubriand, carved tableside with seasonal vegetables - it was hearty, it was tasty.  Very simple presentation - there is nothing between you and the food.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sauteed Garlic Mushrooms - The sauce left a funny, stingy, slighty charred aftertaste.  Not a fan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wine List:  Seriously lacking.  What's this of not having ANY Chateauneuf Du Pape?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ambiance:\n",
      "Elegant, modern, simple, and warm.  I wouldn't mind living in this place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service:\n",
      "He did his best, but it was quite apparent that he was tired.  The poor guy.  When asked for a suggestion on a Red, he immediately suggested that there was a sommelier onsite.  C'mon buddy, you gotta try just a little, even if it is bulldoohicky! \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall:\n",
      "Be warned - you're paying for the ambiance and the Emeril name.  The food was delicious, but really not uberrifically succulent and extraordinary and memorable and, and....need I go on.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Even though many people don't like Emeril, I actually like him (and his show) because it's entertaining.  So, I naturally had to try this place.\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked the service and the ambiance at the restaurant.  Food was delicious, but not to the point where I would return for a second outing.  I asked the host if I can pick up my bone-in steak with my hand and eat.  His answer: \"Only if you lift up your pinky.\"  Ha, clever!\n",
      "\n",
      "Food + Wine for two people came out to just under $200 before tip.  Thank you to my wonderful friend in Las Vegas for paying for this dinner!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Good for the management to reach out and connect with me.  I hope they are sincere in making an effort to make this establishment a better experience for everyone.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I came here for work - I am not a big steak eater so if that is the kind of review you are looking for skip it.  Everyone knows the real reason to go to steak houses is for the side dishes and they do have good side dishes.  Our server was also very friendly about our changing party size and I had no problems with the reservations.  I am giving it 4 instead of 5 bc of ambiance- they could have done a little better here.  It is a little boring and white-walled, plus the bar area feels too open to the casino for me.  Plus side though it is right around the corner from the new Barneys so you can buy bags or shoes before/after.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I have traveled all over the world tasting the best foods offered in Paris, Rome, New Zealand, Figi, etc and Delmonico's in Las Vegas remains my favorite restaurant.  The bone-in-ribeye is the best I've ever had -- even better than Mastro's in Beverly Hills and Thousand Oaks.  The service is unbelievable (three designated servers per table) and everything we've ever eaten here has been perfect.  My sister came here after eloping 10 years ago in Vegas.  My husband and I came here 7 years ago after eloping (yeah, my family seems to like eloping in Vegas :)) and we've flown here several times since for the sole purpose of a great meal.  If you're in Vegas, I recommend this restaurant above all others.  But be prepared to spend $100-$150/pp.  I haven't been here in over a year but am going tonight.  I wanted to post this review in advance for the past five times I've been here just in case it's not as great.  Either way, I'll post another review after our most recent dinner tonight.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Consistent food - great atmosphere\n",
      "Clearly a great place to bring clients. \n",
      "Service was ok , friendly and efficent\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Wonderful experience, food was fantastic and our Waiter, Lamont was top notch.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Second time I have been here. The strip steak here goes down as the best steak overall I have ever had. God the creamed corn is heavenly as well. This place is not afraid of butter, yay! Will be back\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I been here prob 5x let me tell you this is the BEST in Vegas they really knows how to cook their steak\n",
      "Service is great they really want to make you happy \n",
      "However the sides is just ok nothing to write home about\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We had a memorable dinner celebrating our anniversary at Delmonico Steakhouse having our usual classic choices plus some signature Emeril dishes. The service was everything that you would expect from an Emeril restaurant plus more with Chef Rainwater and staff rolling out the red carpet making the night special for my wife and I.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greeted with congratulations on our anniversary at the host stand, we were seated immediately for our Thursday night 8 PM reservation along the wall in the classy main dining room. A nice touch that we noticed toward the end of the meal was that although the restaurant was almost at capacity, no diners were sat at any adjacent table leaving us secluded for the entire meal. We had a few bonus tastings added to our meal including two complimentary celebratory desserts. And at the end of the meal, the friendly manager who was overseeing our entire meal, escorted us to the kitchen where we had a brief word with Chef Rainwater and photo op.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're looking for a cocktail, check out their creative list which some of the drinks looked very interesting, but I just stayed with my Irish whiskey. The wine list is also extensive enough that they carried a couple of choices for my picky wife. Emeril mainstays such as the barbecue shrimp and banana cream pie are items that you should try at least once. The poached main lobster was a special for the night that did not disappoint. The highlight for my meal was the bone in ribeye with Creole seasoning topped with maitre d' butter. I savored every bite of the dry aged beef and I don't think there's much doubt that I could have eaten another one.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tab was just over two bills which I had no problem with the splurge and felt it was well worth it with the gracious hospitality we received. You'll find your classic steakhouse dishes at Delmonico but you'll also see some twists with Creole influence. You'll also be assured that the service will uphold the Emeril standard.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] It's hard for me to only give four stars but....  I ate at CUT WHICH IS a two minute walk from Delmonicos two nights ago.   The service was great the food was good but CUT is a masterpiece the Mona Lisa.  I ordered the spinach salad which was very good fresh and delicious.  For my main course I ordered the bone in rib eye \"house specialty\"  it was great but it did not compare to the magic of my CUT ribeye.  This is an excellent restaurant the only flaw is its two minutes away from CUT!  It's like playing basketball next to Jordan baseball next to Ruth.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Lovely ambiance and decor. Excellent customer service. But for an Emeril restaurant, I expected waaaaay more flavour. Granted, I did order chicken (and I have yet to visit an upscale steakhouse who doesn't serve bland, dry chicken). \n",
      "\n",
      "We came for thanksgiving dinner. There was a nice crowd... an older crowd. It's inside the Venetian. I ordered a loaded baked potato (or some potato dish) as a side. It looked beautiful and scrumptious but right after you get past the cheese and sour cream it's bland. I probably won't be back. But I can see why people like it.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Celebrated our anniversary with a staycation at the Palazzo. We went here for dinner and had eaten here before. It impressed us again. I asked them to make us Parmesan steak fries cooked in truffle oil. They went iron chef on us and obliged without a question! Great meal all the way around!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Beautiful restaurant, thoughtful staff. Some of the best food I have ever had plus kick ass cocktails. My only complaint is not their fault. We are only in vegas for 2 nights and i see a food coma in my future.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The best steakhouse I've been to in all of Las Vegas the food is just amazing. The service is amazing our server Frank just made me and my family feel at home and he was extremely attentive to us. I ordered the Lobster and the rib eye. They where both superb dishes that I highly recommend. The rib eye was extremely succulent and well cooked . The lobster was incredibly juicy and the tastiest lobster I've had in my whole life. But our server Frank is what really made this place so great and unforgettable! He was the nicest  I've ever had the pleasure to meet. A big shout out to Frank, you rock!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Had a great time here.  The private room in the back overlooking the kitchen was a great touch. The service was amazing. The bone in ribeye was fantastic. Cooked perfectly and was tender and flavorful. A scoop of melting butter sat on top of the ribeye. Everything was great. I loved the twice baked potato. It was tremendous. The portion was huge and had an amazing taste. Highly recommend it. Great wine list. Great variety. The lower priced wines were good and the more expensive wines were vast and impressive. The sommelier was so helpful and knowledgeable. We had a great discussion and were able to identify the best wine for me, for this meal.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Perhaps my expectations were too high.\n",
      "Let me start off by saying, the hype about their 16 oz Bone-in Ribeye ($52) is well deserved.  It's flavorful, has exquisite marbling, and served at a medium rare perfection.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that's where the hype ends.  Sure, the lobster bisque is good and the shrimp appetizer is tasty, but for what we paid overall, I know there are better options here in the city.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So, I would say to you -- go for their Bone-in Ribeye and leave all other expectations behind.  It's a great meal, just didn't make it to my list of favorites.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] When I was looking for a place for dinner for my birthday celebration weekend, this place wasn't really high on my list. When it comes to purses, shoes and sometimes clothes, I'll put down a pretty penny or hundred for nice stuff. But when it comes to food, I think to myself, \"Is it really worth the cost to put something in only to have it come out?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, \"Yes!\" Okay... Sort of... \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the boneless Ribeye and a side of broccoli. Ribeye was good - just enough flavor and not too salty. Being the carnivore that I am, I was shocked that I really enjoyed the broccoli too. It was as perfect as steamed vegetables could get. It was bright green from top to bottom and crispy, not mushy. \n",
      "\n",
      "My sister had pasta with shrimp. I must say, though there was shrimp on her plate, they were not \"shrimp\" at all! They were huge!! Seriously, Delmonico must get their produce, seafood and meat from \"Food Heaven R Us\" or something. \n",
      "\n",
      "Although the food was good, I would say the service is what gives Delmonico 4-stars. Again, I'm not a frequent fine diner. So, to have my water glass filled up every time it gets low to having another (delicious) roll magically appear on my plate just as I suck in the last mouthful is fantastic! I'd even go so far as to say they'd probably spray the air around me with something fragrant once the broccoli hit you know where. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now I can see why it's worth it to pay at least $50 for dinner. Thanks Emeril!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The BBQ shrimp and truffle chips are excellent.  We were a party of 3 and 2 of the filets came out way under cooked and the bone out ribeye looked like it was purchased at the local super market. Looked like a $10 casino special steak not a $51 one. I have made better at home.  I was very disappointed based on the other reviews.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Great service, nice food....  I am a sucker for foies gras and bone in ribeye steak.  Everyone was pleased with how their meat was cooked (that doesn't sound right) but I think the highlight was the bread pudding.  It was amazing.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Frankly, I was impressed with the quality of the food an overall experience.  It also wasn't a grip like Lawry's normally is.  Definitely would consider going back.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My wife and I had a great meal(lobster sliders, lobster bisque, gumbo, etc.) and it was delicious. The service was amazing and we had a great waiter named Drew McKenzie who was top notch. We'll be back again with our business team! Highly recommended.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My rating is based on my personal preference of how a steak should be cooked. I don't like it charred so to me their steaks were just okay. I've had better = Mastros! Still my #1 in Orange County. \n",
      "\n",
      "Their lobster bisque was yummy. Large lobster chunks!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Based on prior reviews, we tried the Chateaubriand cooked tableside for two. We were definitely not disappointed and the meat melted in my mouth. But the best part of this place is the impeccable service. Several different people attended to us throughout the night and topped it all off with a complimentary dessert to celebrate our honeymoon!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Awesome place to eat. Steaks were amazing and so was the twice baked potato. The star of the night however was the table side caesar salad. The large croutons were the best we have ever had by far.  The drink I had was the b.b.s and it was great. Our server John was great as well. We will be back.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I wouldn't call myself fancy. I wouldn't call myself classy. I wouldn't call myself upscale.\n",
      "So when I go restaurants that are fancy, classy and upscale I immediately feel like everyone in there can tell I don't belong. I don't know what fork is for what. I don't know where to put my napkin when I get up from the table and I swear everyone else notices. I also don't venture to fancy, classy and upscale places cause I almost always hate the food.\n",
      "The fancier the words on the menu the less I wanna try it. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is NOT that kind of place. Yes, it is fancy, classy and upscale. Yes the menu is a bunch of jibberish food. \n",
      "But somehow I was still able to make out a few key words to order what was Caprese salad and Potato Soup.\n",
      "HOT DAYUM DUDE: Emeril is no joke.\n",
      "The Caprese was so fresh. The tomato tasted like it was picked 15 minutes before it was cut and placed beautifully on my plate. The Potato soup had big chunks of bacon at the bottom and the server poured my soup over it. Then added a junk of Parmesan cheese and yuuum.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other fancy, classy and upscale joints I feel uncomfortable to even speak to my serious server. Not this guy. Our server was casual yet still very serious about his job. He even cracked a smile a few times. \n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot rave enough about this place. It was beautiful and elegant, delicious and exciting flavors. I loved every second of Delmonico\n",
      "\n",
      "My two small complaints\n",
      "1. The bathroom smells like wet rocks. Its has really cook huge rock walls but since its in a bathroom it smells weird. You know the smell of a dirty lake? That is the smell the bathroom had.\n",
      "2. This restaurant is inside the Venetian and VERY hard to find. There are no signs. None. Pointing you toward it. So from me to you: If you find the huge LOVE sign for the Beatles show it is directly to the right, almost hidden by the sign and the elevator.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Our last night in Vegas & my daughter & I went to Delmonico for dinner.  The service was tops, our waiter Frank was the best!  We had the barbecue shrimp appetizer-excellent!  So tasty and the sauce--so good!  My daughter ordered the NY sirloin and I ordered the lobster bisque.  The steak was superb; like cutting butter and seasoned perfectly.  Unfortunately, I became suddenly ill totally unrelated to the food and had to leave for a bit.  When I returned Frank, our waiter seemed quite concerned and brought me a club soda.  Sadly I wasn't able to eat my meal or have the banana cream pie I had dreamed about sharing with my daughter.  I was not charged for my bisque or the club soda; which I really expected to pay for.  The care and courtesy extended to me was so appreciated!  Emeril should be proud of your employees especially Frank!  Thank you all so much!!!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Best meal EVER! (also the most expensive...but worth it).\n",
      "\n",
      "The food was just unbelieveable. We had a special gnocchi/lump crab appetizer, wedge salad, filet & ribeye, roasted potatoes w/garlic, and pecan pie for dessert. Food coma! Everything was absolutely perfect and the service was excellent. Highly recommended for a special occasion.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] One of my favorite restaurants!  The service was wonderful, the staff was friendly and attentive.   the restaurant was beautiful.  I loved the fact that the restaurant was nice and yet it didn't have a stuffy air to it.\n",
      "The food was excellent!  My petit filet just melted in my mouth.  My friend's halibut was moist and delicious.  I am definitely going back again ... and again!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Truffle chips were so delicious.  Caesar isn't really worth it.  Steak was ok, needed more flavor in my opinion.  So happy to see foie gras on their menu but it was just ok - I've had better.  The scalloped potatoes were under cooked so we had to send it back - boo boo.  Everything else was ok.  Great service.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] great place to spurge.  heirloom tomato with burrata was fresh and delicious.  Steak (Ribeye) was cooked to perfection and the seasoning gave it a little extra flavor without overpowering.  Make sure to save room for Emeril's signature banana cream pie.  It was amazing and beautiful.  Each bite was perfectly ripe.  The layering of the pie made it picture worthy.  We also had the lobster bisque and the Bronzino which were good but similar to what I have had at other restaurants.  The highlights were really the steak and banana cream pie.\n",
      "My dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives was also spot on.\n",
      "Service was truly exceptional.  Servers worked as a team that was a well oiled machine.  Impressive to see all plates landing at the same time including at the large tables near us.  Ambiance was modern.  Chairs were so comfortable, you can really get comfy and enjoy the meal.\n",
      "To be honest, some meals in Vegas are not always worth the price tag so I was a little skeptical.  I was so happy that this was not the case here and Delmonico's really delivered.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Really nice ribeye but not great. It had really good flavor but not quite as tender as I expected for prime beef. \n",
      "The service was great and so were the sides and salads.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My new husband and I just got married in Vegas on the 4th of August, and we went here on the 6th to celebrate during our vacation. We called for reservations on the day of, and they were able to accommodate us. When we arrived early, we sat in the bar area, and we had the most amazing drinks we both had ever had. I had a \"green spade\" which had cucumber, basil, and some other stuff in it. It was light, not to sweet and delicious. He had a bloody orange, which is a whiskey cocktail, and he loved it equally. I also had a limelight, which was good, and the best was the dark roast....delicious, smooth and incredible. They were about $14 a piece, and worth every damn penny. We were seated 15 minutes early. We told the waiter that this was our first \"casual fine dining\" experience, and he was more than informative. Made suggestions throughout the meal, and was personable and forthcoming. They had a nice \"Our top Picks\" for the wine. We chose a mid-price cab sav. They gave us complimentary truffle cream for an app, and then we ordered the tuna to go with it. The tuna was just average, but we live in Cocoa beach, so it's hard to impress us with seafood. The main event was the bone-in ribeye. I have eaten a shit ton of steak in my life....and DEAR GOD. This steak was impeccable. I didn't need a knife, I used my fork to cut it. The seasoning was just right, and I ordered mine rare, and that was how it was. My husbands was just the right medium rare....and perfect. Now, the only negative part of our meal. I ordered fingerling potatoes and asparagus as our sides. I had to send the potatoes back. They were nearly raw, and dry. The asparagus was edible, but boring. At nine dollars a piece, I expect a little zing. We were too full for dessert, but I'm sure it was great. The service was perfect, three waiters to a table. I was impressed with our overall bill total. They gave us cards that detailed where we sat and what waiters we had, so that we could have the same ones next year when we return for our anniversary. I will def be willing to return for another beautiful, whole experience.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Service was great but being a steakhouse, I would have expected a lot better steaks! Table ordered 1 filet, 3 ribeyes and a New York - meat lacked seasoning, dry and 3 of the 5 were overcooked! Side dishes were okay. Best thing was the wedge salad! Definitely not a place I would return!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I have been to many steak places in Vegas and had always wanted to go, but it can be hard to get a reservation. This time we planned way in advance so we could eat at a reasonable time. \n",
      "\n",
      "The food: The food was reasonable but slightly over priced. The steak that I had was good and cooked to how I ordered it, but for $52.00, it could have been better. Since it was served a la carte, I ordered a baked potato, $8.00.  I would suggest the pecan pie for dessert, best I have ever had.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service: Some of the best service I have every see before. Everything was excellent from the moment our server arrived at our table to the moment we left. Very professional but not to stuffy. All of his suggestions were right on.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not sure I would go again, since there are so many places to choose from, but I would suggest it to my friends.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Fantastic experience. Went here with a group of 9 and we all enjoyed ourselves. The service was exceptional; the lobster bisque was generous with the portions of lobster; and the bone in strip steak was good (although not the best I've had.) A friend had the salmon and said it was in his top 5 restaurants ever.  For sides we had broccoli and mash for the table..both were good. I'd definitely go back.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My friend and I really wanted to try one of the best steakhouses in Vegas, and people kept telling us about how great Delmonico was, so we gave it a try. It was my friend's birthday dinner and she is a huge meat eater, I on the other hand don't actually like steak all that much, but WOW! It is absolutely impossible not to enjoy your meal here. \n",
      "\n",
      "We were in a rush because we had tickets to a show and we were already running late. We advised our maitre d' that we had barely one hour to eat dinner and be on our way. He went above and beyond to make sure we got service fast and made the show on time. Not only was he absolutely efficient in making sure our food came out quickly, but he was also super friendly and attentive with us. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our cocktails took no time at all to arrive and were done perfectly. We didn't have time to get appetizers which was a big disappointment, so we went straight for the main course. I had the rib eye and smashed potatoes, my friend had the fillet Mignon and fingerling potatoes, and we also shared some buttered asparagus. All the food was top notch and delicious. My rib eye was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and was well seared on the outside. Like I said, I don't particularly like steak but this was mind blowing amazing! I had a few bites of my friend's fillet Mignon and it was melt in your mouth goodness. I don't know that it could be possible, but it was even better than my rib eye. Amazing. \n",
      "\n",
      "The sides were also very good, specially the country smashed potatoes which were buttery and creamy. They had bacon and what I think were leeks in them. Yum. The asparagus were cooked to perfection and seasoned just right. I did not try the fingerling but my friend said she wasn't overly impressed by them. \n",
      "\n",
      "My friend was also surprised with an apple cider sorbet and a candle - for her birthday. The sorbet was delicious, light and refreshing. All in all our visit to Delmonico was fantastic and worth every single dollar we paid. Dinner here is pricey, but seriously if you find yourself in Las Vegas, you'd be crazy not to come here!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Delmonico Steakhouse was pretty good, but definitely not the best I've had nor without flaws.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food and drink choices seem to be where they really excel, as there were a number of options that my girlfriend and I found to be mouth-watering, from the bone-in ribeye, the fillet, the chicken, salmon, etc.  They had my favorite beer (Chimay Blue) and she enjoyed her wine (she had the Chardonnay and Riesling).  What we wanted when going here was a nice, fancy dinner as a tribute to our vacation together.  It wasn't a special occasion or anything but we like to have a quality dinner from time to time.  I'd say the food part of Emeril's more or less did the trick with regards to that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was OK.  While they were relatively prompt the matre'd was the person who seemed to be serving us and he was just a little too over-the-top for me, not to mention he seemed a little condescending and careless.  Perhaps I just read into it wrong, but I didn't feel as comfortable as I have at other restaurants.  Our waiters made sure the waters and bread kept coming, which I appreciated.  The matre'd didn't really do anything rude per-say, but I did notice that at one point when he came by to check on everything he spoke with the tables on our left and right but not with us.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The smaller tables are a little too big IMO, my girlfriend and I felt a mile away from each other and eventually I just moved my place settings next to her and sat with her so we could talk easier.  This is probably not an issue if you have a big group, but for a romantic evening it wasn't fantastic.  Speaking of romance, there were no candles, the lightning was bright, and the restaurant was devoid of decor. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't mean to rip Delmonico's so much but I just want to stress that this restaurant really doesn't deserve 5 stars despite the food being pretty tasty.  Our stakes came out medium rare as requested, they were juicy and delicious, and the side \"double-baked potato\" + \"Asparagus\" was fantastic.\n",
      "\n",
      "I realized going here and glancing at the menu online that the prices were going to be steep but I guess my wallet received a shock even so.  I had initially been hoping that our bill would come to about $115-130, but in the end it was $200 because you have to buy sides for your meal separately and the wine / beer was very expensive.  The problem with this is that in Vegas there is a lot of competition and I've had food that was on par with this for under half the price of what I paid.  For instance Mon Ami Gabi (outside of Paris, Paris) and Trevi (Ceasar's Palace Forum Shops) both run in the $60-100 range (for two) and are just as tasty IMO.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, there were a nat or two flying around toward the end of our meal, something which is unacceptable in a restaurant of this caliber.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoyed the overall experience but I would not dine here again.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I ate here years ago.  I had a nice meal but I don't remember much.  I went back last week with my husband and another couple. The steak was wonderfully done.  It has a wonderful feel inside the restaurant - big and airy.  We had the tuna and salmon tartar to start then shared the bone-in ribeye.  It really was good.  I'd go back in a second.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Superb!\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm sure people can knock off stars if their steaks didn't come out to their liking (heck I would too), but all four of ours came out exactly as we wanted them to.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not a big fan of Ermiril's show, nor am I a fan of his personality.  Despite having his name associated with this restaurant, I feel that if he's not the one cooking my meal, then it's not really his food.  Whoever the chef was that night sure had his mojo going that's for sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cocktail shrimp appetizer was amazing.  Cocktail shrimp you say?  How different can that be from Bellagio's buffet where you can get like 1000 in one sitting if you wanted?  Well considering you're saving your stomach for more desirable substances, the dish contained eight snicker bar sized prawns drizzled with a fine cocktail sauce that had a nice kick to it.  It was more than enough to satiate us before the main course.\n",
      "\n",
      "When our meat came out, my buddy and I couldn't stop drooling.  The girls had to laugh as their softball sized fillet's looked more like golf balls in comparison to our full-sized cow bone-in Rib-Eyes.  Literally the size of the plate itself, and at least 1.5 inches thick....Vegans would run in fear at the sheer size of this holy beast.  The rib eyes were cooked perfectly throughout.  Medium-rare, a beautiful mix of pink and red with a perfectly charred (requested) exterior that seared all the juices in and added wonderful flavor to the aged meat.  If this wasn't a proper meal we would've gone to town on the bones like cavemen at the end.  Truly magnificent.  And to think, they were offering a \"Generous Cut\" Porterhouse on the menu as well.....that might have been size of.....two cows (40-50 ounces per what our waiter quoted)\n",
      "\n",
      "The sides were just as delightful.  Served family style, the Asparagus was grilled perfectly, the potato fingerlings roasted with a beautiful blend of butter and garlic, and the mushroom medley was bursting with flavor.  I will also add that the dinner rolls are probably some of the best I've ever had.  Soft and fresh hot out of the oven, they had a nice sweetness to them and the fresh churned butter added an exquisite country taste as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dessert consisted of an excellent bread pudding with a scoop or Oreo ice cream, along with a Banana Fosters cream pie.  Both were amazingly good.  I have no idea how we stomached them, but they were a nice finishing touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wine list is extensive and amazing.  They're one of the few restaurants in Vegas that serve one of my favorite wineries wine (Neal).  We had an absolutely dazzling bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon, that we had to order another.  Needless to say, both gentleman slugged down 75% of a bottle each.  : )\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was excellent.  our waiter was attentive at all times and was very alert to our needs.  The best waiters are those that know what you want without even having to signal or tell them, and our waiter was just that good.\n",
      "\n",
      "A very elegant setting and located in the walkway connecting the Palazo and Venetian, this is definitely one of the steakhouses in Vegas I will frequent again.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Possibly the best steak I ever had. Bone in Rib steak. Definitely recommend. Place is pricey, but 5 stars. Staff was extremely helpful and nice. Had a great experience. Didn't feel at all like I was in a shopping mall in a Casino like some other Vegas spots.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Overall, this is a good option for a high-end steakhouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "I order the filet mignon medallions and they were incredible. \n",
      "\n",
      "The turn-off for me was the service.  Super slow service and I felt that we were at times treated like second-class citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh well!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We had lunch here. BBQ shrimp and salmon, both excellent. Emeril's food is fairly heavy so you will be filled. Everything was great. Lunch is cheaper than dinner and many of the same items are available.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] OH MY GOSH! Whenever someone brings up food and Vegas, I always have to mention this place. It's so freaking awesome. The services is awesome, my friend dropped a spoon and before she could pick it up, she was handed a new one already. Then when dishes arrived, everyone got their plates at the exact same time. They had like 5 servers placing a dish in front of each person. We also got free crabcakes which was really nice of them. Now the food. Man yes it's expensive but SO WORTH IT! I mean you get a lot of food and the food is so freaking good. I have never tasted a ribeye steak greater than this one. It like melted in your mouth, even though meat isn't suppose to do that, I meant that it was so tender OH MY GOSH! I'm so going back next time I'm in Vegas. Their drinks are really good too. Man no complaints at all about this place!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I had the summer special petite ribeye, gumbo, smashed potatoes and vanilla ice cream for dessert. I also had a side of BBQ shrimp. Everything was amazing! This is definitely the best steak I've ever had. The BBQ shrimp are expertly prepared. I'd definitely recommend anyone eating here. I had eaten here back in 2002 and it was the best meal I had ever had, I was excited to return and see if it still was as great. It definitely was!  The service was the best we had all weekend. Such a great place to dine.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We went here for brunch, the service was impeccable.  Our waters was filled without asking, food came in steady stream, they checked on us consistently but not to the point where it gets uncomfortable.  We had the tiger shrimp with avocado and chicken gumbo as appetizers.  The shrimp was so good, super sweet and fresh.  Chicken gumbo was good too and I'm not even a gumbo type of person.   \n",
      "My SO and I both had the Prime Burger as our main course, and wow the burger was huge!  My SO is a pretty big eater and he could only finish 2/3 of the burger.  I had half of mine left over, I desperately wanted to finish it though.  The burgers were very rich, meaty, and just everything that a good burger should be.  \n",
      "I didn't give this place a 4 star because of our short trip to vegas we couldn't go back to eat dinner, but we'll be back soon and hopefully I can give this place a 5 star.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This is not my first time at Delmonico. I was in Vegas a few years ago on business (again) and had a group dinner (10-12 people) here. I did not make the reservation but the person who did somehow got us the chef's table. If you are not familar...the chef's table is it's own room separate but right next to the kitchen. Because the room is made up of clear glass...we could see right into the kitchen and watch our meals being made. It was very cool. We did the tasting menu. It was all great and the portions were so large that by round 4 I was uncomfortably full...and still had the steak course to go! \n",
      "\n",
      "I came back for dinner last week with some friends for dinner. No chef's table this time...sat in the regular ole dining area. Service was pretty good and I thought the food delivered (although my initial experience was a bit more memorable). We had the calamari with an live tapenade and also the BBQ shrimp. I thought the calamari was good, not spectacular (this would not have been my first choice as an app but I wasn't the only one at dinner). I thought the BBQ shrimp was delicious and had great flavor, cooked perfectly. Split a blue cheese wedge - can't go wrong there. I had the mixed grill special which came with a piece of pork tenderloin, slab of bacon & a piece of andouille sausage all served over greens and andouille grits. Delicous! The andouille sausage was the star of the plate as far as I'm concerned. My friend had a ribeye and a cheddar twice baked potato and enjoyed it. Someone else got the pork tenderloin off the regular menu which came with grits, greens & cornbread pancakes (which were tasty). All of us enjoyed our meals. I think it's a nice little \"splurge\" for dinner. \n",
      "\n",
      "I do agree with another reviewer who said that the ambience is nothign special (unless you get the chef's table of course) and that the steak selection was nothing different - same cuts of meat as other fine steak houses. I didn't see that \"wow\" factor onthe menu...which is why I ordered one of the specials.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Ate at kitchen table for 40th birthday. Great experience. The sous chef was a little nervous but the sommelier was great. Definitely get the wine pairing. Filet mignon with mushrooms and foie gras was a great combination of flavors. Desserts are amazing. Thanks Delmonico!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Went here over the past weekend just to try. Have been to other steakhouses like cut, Ruth cris, morels, summit house in Fullerton, and lawrys. Safe to say food was decent considering the price. \n",
      "\n",
      "Filet mingnon was tender but good. Not great. I have liked the filet at cut much better. \n",
      "\n",
      "Crab legs were bland but amazingly precut and offered at either a cold or hot temperature. \n",
      "\n",
      "The lobster bisque was ok too. I think I had expected the greatness I found with McCormick's lobster bisque. Safe to say for the price I would probably go to cut again or lawrys or McCormick. Probably wouldn't want to go back here. Sorry kids. But that's just me.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Outstanding!! Service - Perfect!! Food - Excellent and large portion size!  Clean & Elegant.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Maybe because I'm use to NY Steakhouses but I was disappointed. \n",
      "I was with a party of 10 for lunch. Lunch menu was great however my steak was over cooked. \n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Hey everyone - first yelp review. And what better way to kick it off than with the wonderful Delmonico Steakhouse in the Venetian Hotel and Casino. This is my first Emeril's experience and it was a good one. \n",
      "\n",
      "Disclaimer: A fraternity brother of mine is a manager here and insisted that my group try it! \n",
      "\n",
      "I was in town for a bachelor party and 8 of us dined here on a Friday night. We had a reservation for 8:30 and were seated promptly. The appetizers included delicious (albeit greasy) chips sprinkled with parmesan cheese and the New Orleans BBQ Shrimp with biscuit. The shrimp were easily the most tasty that I've ever had - my only complaint is that one order ($18 only included 3 shrimp). I wish I had 2 or even three. The biscuit was pointless for this entree (and barely noticeable), It actually went uneaten as our party was preoccupied with the wonderful hot butter rolls that they continued to bring around.\n",
      "\n",
      "For my entree I had the filet mignon ($48) and it was absolutely fabulous. I order my steaks medium well to well, which could sometimes mean a loss of flavor if it's not done right. In this case, the steak was cooked perfectly and had a ton of flavor. This was easily the best steak I've ever had - and I'm a red meat fan. \n",
      "\n",
      "Service was excellent, atmosphere was a bit gloomy (although aren't good steak houses supposed to be?) and I was simply too full to try dessert. The rest of the party thoroughly enjoyed their meal. The highlight of the evening may have been seeing Larry Flynt seated just a few feet away from us, enjoying his steak and eggs. Apparently he's a regular.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're in Vegas and looking for a sure-fire steakhouse, stop by Emeril's Delmonico. You WON'T be disappointed.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My husband and I have enjoyed Emeril's restaurants. But when we tried Delmonico's, it was unbelievable. We had the best meal ever. It's worth the money. I think it's the best of all Emeril's restaurants. I have no more words, speachless. You all should to try it.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This is mine and my fiancé's favorite steakhouse here in Las Vegas! We often stop in and see our favorite server, Michael Jackson, who simply completes the fine dining experience for us. He is always so pleasant and knowledgable about the menu and suggests amazing dishes each time! I have never been disappointed here and will be back soon!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Food amazing, mushrooms and Rack of lamb were excellent. Truffle chips so addicting! I had made an advance reservation and made a comment that it was my boyfriends birthday and asked for a special table. When we arrived the hostess seated us at a table 2 feet from other guests on one side and up against a wall on the other side. When I asked her if they had a nicer table she said that the dining room was full. Then she looked around and asked what table I wanted. I told her that I had requested a nice cozy table when I made my reservation. I was disappointed in the location of the table especially since I had made that specific request. She then moved us to a table that was right next to the entrance and sound volume buttons/lighting controls of the restaurant. It also was not what I expected but at least we weren't right next to another group. Throughout dinner the managers were constantly walking by and playing with the volume buttons and lighting buttons on the wall. On a good note , our server and the food was exceptional however I have been to several fine dining restaurants and was disappointing that my small request was not granted. It's the little things that make a difference.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] What a great find! I had eaten here once before for a corporate event, but this time it was for a nice meal with my wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wine list is amazing (almost overwhelming)! Service was some of the best we've ever had! Our drinks never got below half empty and the food was outstanding! The Filet was a little (very little) tough, but the flavor was outstanding! You really cannot go wrong with this place!\n",
      "\n",
      "BAM!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] A first class steak house and pricey. Everything is a la carte. I ordered a glass of wine, the wedge salad, filet mignon and a twice baked potato and it was a little over $100. The filet was excellent. A couple  at my table ordered the Cesar salad for two and it was prepared table side, it looked so good! The only reason for not giving the restaurant a five star rating was the noise level. We arrived about 9:30 pm and it was a Friday night and there were many bachelor party tables. Having a casual conversation was difficult.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We went to Delmonico's a few years ago (while I was undecided if I was an Emeril fan or not...turns out, I'm not).  Didn't care for our meal, but the one thing that stood out was the Banana Cream Pie.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we were back in Vegas we stopped by just for a slice of that pie. A few years later and its as good as I remembered. I'm picky about bananas, not a pie person, and still this pie is amazing.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I thought it was good, but not $300 good for a couple.  Service was good, my steak was good, and the little grilled cheese were good, but I honestly expected to be blown away.  It is Emeril after all!!!  I would have been just as content spending a hundred bucks less at any number of other great restaurants in Vegas\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This was an experience meal, and totally the right choice for my 30th birthday dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was special. Lots of attention to detail, and I left feeling spoiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the bone-in ribeye, and it was a serious steak. I cook a dry-aged steak from my local butcher pretty well. I'll satisfy any friend of mine with that, and I'm always happy with my work. This steak was just long beyond anything I could have made. Great quality meat, wonderful seasoning, perfect crust, cooked to perfect medium rare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their special Mai Tai is really, really good. If you want an appetizer, the heirloom tomato salad we had was amazing, drizzled with balsamic, oil, and mozzarella. Also really enjoyed the parmesan truffle oil chips that our friends ordered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Expensive, but one of the few meals I've had that can justify this kind of price.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The original New Orleans Delmonicos gave me some of earliest foodie education.  WAY back before it was bought by Emeril, it was a Garden District favorite.  Many of the old, wealthy families of New Orleans dined there.  It was not on the tourist trail.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was distraught when Emeril bought Delmonicos.  I thought he was cheesy and obnoxious, and I just knew he was going to ruin this Southern matriarch.  I could not bring myself to go there and view the damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I found out a Delmonicos had opened in Vegas.  Who cared if it is cheesy I thought...we're in Vegas, home of cheesiness!  So, Sugar Bear and I checked it out in 2001.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We were delighted to see that there was a strict dress code.  Our meal was splendifferous.  The presentation--stunning.  The restaurant--breathtaking.  I could not believe it!  Delmonicos had not been ruined by Emeril after all.  He had taken my favorite old school restaurant from New Orleans and made her into a youthful Southern Belle again.  We were dazzled.\n",
      "\n",
      "We returned to Delmonicos a year later to celebrate our wedding.  Perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've been several times since, and have always loved our meals.  It has been disappointing that the dress code has become lax.  Last time we were there, we saw jeans and shorts.  Downgrade for a place that previously required a coat.  I guess dress codes don't really fly with the younger crowd, and this Southern lady has had to ride with the times.  \n",
      "\n",
      "If you are in Vegas, or New Orleans, this is not a place to miss!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We walked all over the palazzo and Venetian looking at our options for a nice steakhouse. Overall, for the menu and value we went to this restaurant. By far, one of the best steakhouses we have been to in Vegas. The servers were on point, and the food was out of this world. If anything please save room and have the oatmeal crusted pecan pie with praline ice cream. It may sound a little weird, but it was the best dessert I have ever had. And I eat a lot of dessert! It wasn't overly sweet, you get an individual pie of delicious goodness! Take a break from those table games and make your way here, it will not disappoint!!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I wanted to get a nice steak while in Vegas.  There were several options in Venetian/Palazzo alone.  I picked this one because, well, bam!  No but I figured a guy like Emeril Lagasse would make sure his steakhouse served a nice steak.\n",
      "\n",
      "The decor inside is nice and clean, not a whole lot going on.  The opposite of a Red Robin, say.  Service was duly attentive.  Caesar salad prepared table-side was a treat.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We went with cocktails over wine from the rather pricey and extensive wine list.  I didn't even eyeball the list personally.  But a generous portion of Bombay Sapphire satisfied nicely.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I went with a bone-in New York, medium-rare.  It was cooked expertly.  It had great texture and flavor, a nice creole seasoning rub on there but not too heavily applied.  The beef did the talking.  Or the mooing.  It was good.  Only ordered one side on account of a late lunch and we're not rich: mushrooms sauteed in butter.  I feared some pain old sauteed buttons would come out.  But I was rewarded.  A hearty mix of flavorful 'shrooms, like oyster and chantrelle and maybe porcini or shiitake came out.  Lovely.  And buttery.  and Garlicky.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Stayed at the Venetian and they were advertising how good this restaurant was, so we decided to try it. I was a bit unsure...because the front of the restaurant looked empty (good places are always full!). So we still made reservations and when we arrived we discovered that the actual restaurant portion of the steak house was in a different area and it was a full night!. Our waiter recommended the bone in rib eye which is aged and is their signature plate, and the mashed potatoes. This steak was the best!!! I could not believe how good it was. It was seared and just so good. One order of mashed potatoes is really big so our waiter recommended we shared. We did not even finish that 1 order of tasty mashed potatoes. The service was attentive, and since I love martinis they made me a peach martini.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] So I was in town again and felt like having steak since we ate at Tao the previous night. My friend suggested that I dine here. I liked the mood and settings of the restaurant. We got a quiet cozy corner. Order a few glasses of read wine to go with the filet I ordered. Overall, it was a good experience. Nothing spectacularly special. Food was above average.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We decided to pay Delmonico another visit after how successful our first experience was.  This time we only had a party of 4 (last time we had a party of at least 20).  The service of course was still great.\n",
      "\n",
      "We started with the tuna/salmon tar tare - wasn't mediocre but still good\n",
      "\n",
      "The men ordered the bone-in rib eyes and the ladies ordered the petite rib eye special - that came with a marrow/wine sauce over the steaks in place of butter.  My husband and I both ordered ours medium-rare, the other pair ordered theirs medium.  When we received our steaks, they ended up giving everyone the wrong steaks.  The other couple seemed to have enjoyed our medium-rare steaks though!\n",
      "\n",
      "We ended our dinner sharing 2 desserts, the banana creme pie and creme brulee - both were yummy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside of our mixed up orders, we will definitely be back.  Their steaks melt like butta!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Came here for lunch during restaurant week with a few other Yelpers. It's located in the Venetian, but it's easier if you self park at Palazzo to find it. If you self park, you have to walk through the entire hotel to get to restaurant row, which is where Delmonico's is located.\n",
      "I was the first to arrive so I sat in the bar area, which was very cozy. Before long, we were seated at our table. The restaurant had a few others dining in there but it wasn't busy at all.\n",
      "There were 3 waiters servicing our table. One for water, one to clear and one to serve. Maybe not specifically, but it seemed that way. \n",
      "The chef sent over a complimentary appetizer for the table; lemon ricotta served over thinly sliced red apple and bruschetta with tapenade and pesto. (I think a green apple would have been much better. I dont care for the texture nor the taste of red apples) The appetizer was very nice. The soup followed and I didnt care for that one bit. It tasted like warm ketchup. Ew. Ew, ew, ew. So not a fan. Thankfully, that was the only dish I didn't care for. The grilled cheese that accompanied the soup was very good. I enjoyed that quite a bit. The tomato salad and the house green salad that others ordered looked absolutely delicious. Every one finished everything, so I guess they liked it too.\n",
      "The salmon entree was delicious. I asked for it cooked well done and it came back, cooked fantastically! It wasn't medium at all and it was so juicy. Even Christina who likes hers cooked much less, said it was very good. I tried her butternut squash ravioli. It was OK. The flavor in the ravioli was good, but it 1. should have been warmer and 2. the pasta was too soft. It should have been al dente. \n",
      "The dessert was good as well. Your choice between banana cream pie or pecan pie. I opted for the pecan. It was served with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. It was good too. I tried Christina's banana cream pie, and it tasted good, although I didn't care for the look of it, with all those squares of banana. \n",
      "The service was very good, they didn't add the 18% automatically (I prefer when places do that, honestly). The food was good, not great, but good. The price, $30.13 for 3 courses was OK. It was \"pricey\" for lunch, however, the quality of the food and the portions were generous.\n",
      "I dont really see myself going back there. There are a lot of other places I'd like to try and places that I love already that I will return to. It was a great time with great people!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Went a few years back and being a huge fan of Emeril's and loving all his other restaurants I've visited I must say I was quite disappointed w/ the experience. The food was good but it was not fantastic and neither was the ambiance like at his other spots. I went with a large group and some were very pissed while I and the others just enjoyed it. I love the Fish House at MGM and will continue to visit that one but I don't think I'll come back here.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I mainly went for the ceasar salad prepared tableside.  I ate in the bar, the bartender was very nice and helpful.  I got the grilled cheese with tomato soup.  Grilled cheese was very good but the soup was nothing special.  Now the salad that i read one reviewer said the best in vegas, which is the only reason i came.  Knowing that they put anchovies in it when they prepare tableside, i was going to tell them to hold off on that once they get started.  So as im waiting for them to come up and make it, they bring it already prepared.  What is that?  The whole point of getting it is to watch it being done and see that its made fresh.  So obviously the anchovies were already in it, and since i explained i didnt want them, they made another.   I was told its a fire hazard to prepare it in the bar area so they made it on the side when i wasnt looking.  The few bites i took werent that good.  So i watch them make the 2nd salad in the hallway.  Needless to say, it was totally flavorless, ive had better dressing from newmans own, and the lettuce was in long stems, not even cut up. I was very disappointed with the salad, although the other food looked good\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Food was awesome but service was terrible.Went on NYE and waited 20 plus minutes for drinks which kinda set the tone for the dinner.Server was OK but the time from which we ordered to when we received our food was much to long.When I questioned the waiter I was told\" Its not my fault they are way behind in the kitchen\" .This is not the response I expect from a place like this.We may go back but why when there are so many other good steakhouses in Vegas.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Of the half dozen or so high-end steakhouses I've been to, this one would rank in the bottom half.  But among all the steakhouses I've been to, I've enjoyed them all, including this one.  The bone-in ribeye steak I had was good, but not great (i.e. blow my mind).  The tomato salad was good, well-balanced, not too heavy.  Garlic mashed potatoes were ok, nothing special. The sauteed mushrooms were good, but I've had better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ambiance and service were good, I must say.  The waiters were attentive and came by when needed.  The lighting is dark, but not too dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall,  a solid and relatively good eating and dining experience.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] AWESOME!!! Best steak I have EVER had. This is not a chain restaurant, the prices are significant, but the food and service are well worth it in my opinion. I love steak and have tried a variety of great steakhouses in amazing cities, but none can compare to Delmonico's. My wife is generally not impressed by food, she sees it more of necessity that something to be enjoyed, but she continues to rave about Delmonico's. Whenever I'm in Vegas, I will definitely dine at Delmonico's.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Came here as a recommendation from my brother and his wife. They had only been here for their lunch, but we came for their dinner.\n",

      "Easy to make a reservation through yelp via open table. Confirmed.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Oysters:\n",
      "Sort of like the Rockerfeller oysters... I liked it. Not the best but it was good.\n",

      "Shrimp:\n",
      "The sauce was Louisiana style, good but the shrimp was cooked too long. It came out a little 'old'. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bone in Ribeye:\n",
      "The flavors were strong and was there. It had that distinct iron? grilled tast to it. Juicy as well but too chewy for me. Some parts were a bit dry.But it is huge!\n",
      "\n",
      "Creme spinach:\n",
      "Too salty for me but other then that, good.\n",

      "Service: 5 stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why? We told them we were going to catch the show for Ka at the MGM Grand and seating started at 7:30. They made sure everything came out fast and had our check ready for us so we would leave in time. I didn't feel rushed at all, and they were glad to help us out. Thank you! :)\n",
      "\n",
      "I would recommend going there once.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Came here with a large group so was able to try many items.  We had the seafood tower---lobster was amazing.  For dinner, I got the filet which was good but not my favorite filet.  The bone in Ribeye which a majority of people got, looked amazing and everyone who had it loved it.  Desserts were great.  Banana cream pie was delicious\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The delmonico was delicious, the potatoes were excellent, and the deserts were amazing.  After dinner I was thinking about dessert and they suggested the banana cream pie.  Normally banana cream is not my favorite, so I was somewhat skeptical, but the server said that if I did not like it they would not charge me for it. so I gave it a try.  It was amazing, I would recommend it to anyone, but you can get it at any Emeril restaurant so dont go here just for that.  Overall pricy, but very good.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Looking at all the reviews, maybe I went on an off night, but I've had better steaks at home on my own grill from the local market.  Went with a group of 9 and ordered the \"surf and turf\" consisting of the ribeye and a seafood mashed potato combo.\n",
      "\n",
      "The good - Mashed potatoes were excellent, generous lump seafood, very tasty.  Side dishes also were excellent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The disappointing - The ribeye.  Ordered it medium rare, as did my friend next to me.  Both of our steaks were probably cooked closer to medium, neither was juicy or tender, there seemed to be no marbled fat content at all, and the texture was almost grainy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll eat everything from In N Out to more foodie type establishments, always with a smile on my face, but this experience was a bit of a shock to me.  I've had ribeyes for 1/3 the price but infinitely better.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Weird.  But I think I'd rather try somewhere else as I wouldn't want a repeat experience at that price point.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas. Conveniently located in The Venetian and servers are very attentive. Classy, noise level wasn't too high, they even help the ladies with their chair when they sit. Big list of wine choices and they have huge cuts of rib-eye. Full bar you can order drinks from when you first enter the restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "My first time I came with 2 other friends, I believe I ordered the bone-in Ribeye, which is unbelievably HUGE. It was literally bigger than my face. I got my ribeye in medium rare, and came out to be just right. Lots of butter, and we also ordered a couple sides. Picked out a bottle of wine which was the perfect topping to our fatty peices of steak.\n",
      "\n",
      "They also serve dinner rolls! Warm and soft, and lots of butter =]\n",
      "\n",
      "I came back in recent March and ordered a smaller cut, also in medium rare but it wasn't as good as my first time here. Ate here with one other person, he ordered filet mignon which was very tender. We each ordered a glass of wine, although I'd rather choose a bottle instead next time as there are more choices of wine. Also had the lobster bisque, which I absolutely LOVE, so creamy but it was a little thin. Not too many pieces of lobster meat either. Ordered one side, a baked potato which was a little on the dry side.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a small fly that kept flying around us during dinner... It ended up in my water...\n",
      "\n",
      "Had creme brulee for dessert, they also serve homemade madeleine cookies with the creme brulee, both were very good.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I ate here way before I actually knew what fine dining was and when I would laugh over getting two tiny crab cakes for $12. In retrospect, it's a delicious gourmet establishment with a small menu that features a lot of variety - which I find to be extremely rare. \n",
      "\n",
      "The service was excellent and the staff was patient with us asking questions about the food. The environment was very relaxed and there was plenty of space between each table so you felt like you had a bubble around your table. \n",
      "\n",
      "They don't allow flip flops! but they didnt say anything to me...its just on the bottom of their business card :)\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Service is to die for! Ambiance not so much. Floor molding and walls were dirty. Its filet mignon is very basic and if you expect flavor its not for you. Lastly, theyre white truffle chips and bbq shrimp appetizers are worth the price tag. I probably wont go back.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I've heard criticism from others on Delmonico's. Out of the 10 or so times I've been here, always with at least three others at a time or more, I've never had a bad meal. The steaks are superb (I love their bone in rib steak - too big to eat in one sitting -but I manage it anyway), along with their sides, and finally their banana creme pie is to die for - and I normally NEVER order this - I was converted in a hurry and convinced friends who thought I was nuts to try it - they too are converted followers.  Haven't been there in about six months, need to go back next trip soon.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This is my go to spot when I have a steak craving and money to burn. My last birthday was spent here and it was worth. My son and I went, he's 11, and there wasn't any down grade to the service despite it being only 2 of us. I have had this happen in other high end places where they see a kid and think small check. This was some of the best carpaccio around, the drinks were awesome and the steaks cooked perfect;y.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Been here 4 times now. Was in the process of making this place one of those restaurants you gotta visit every time you come into town. Well, I don't feel that way so much any more after our last two visits\n",
      "Service is outstanding.  No complaints when you're pampered.  But there are tons of staff which may explain the prices here. Looked to me like a 3 person team was assigned to 3 tables. Doesn't include the guy bringing the food or the floaters moving about \n",
      "The quality of the food is merely average. 3 of us went, total bill was $360, no drinks.  The BBQ salmon was good, but the overpowering BBQ sauce hid the salmon flavor. My better half had the rack of lamb which she sent back for more cooking because it was raw in the middle. It came back hotter but nearly as raw. She gave up 1/2 through because of all the fat and the rawness. I tried a rib and found it average.  Costco has rack of lamb. Not as meaty but more flavorful than Delmonico.  But that depends on the chef. I had the bone in rib eye, asked for it med rare but it was mostly raw. The tail end was all fat. The flavor was average. For me, part of the cooking process is to turn a steak into a masterpiece. It starts with a prime cut of beef. Apparently, they were out of prime quality steers. This steak had no marbling, just huge fatty areas and lots of tough connective tissue. The tenderness and the tastiness you find in the outer rim of a rib eye wasn't there.  I had to saw through every piece of this steak. Maybe I had a crappy knife.  We had the cream corn and smashed potatoes, both were average. \n",
      "Everything here I could have made at home with better quality and with way more flavor for 1/4 the price. So I'll leave with Foodie's Helpful hints:\n",
      "Start with better quality ingredients. Learn what blue, rare, medium rare and so on are. Learn the point when to remove fish from the heat so it retains its natural flavors and moistness. Don't drown anything in sauce.  Spend some time in the kitchen outside working hours, experimenting, getting the broil and grill times right. Add alittle spice to the popovers might make them really stand out. Allow those steaks to sit outside the refrigerator to warm up before plopping them on a grill. It makes a huge difference  Add fresh corn to the creamed corn. Maybe that will add a little crunch instead of leaving a baby food texture. Liven up your tired old spuds. Liven up all your food.\n",
      "Overall the food quality is 2 stars. The service adds another star.   From now on, we will come here only for the $12 slice of Banana Cream Pie, which is to die for unless the quality starts slipping.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The steak here was just ok. Granted I was h h h h hammered.  But I have a distinct fuzzy memory of it being unmemorable.  Really wish I had gone to Carne Vino or Cut instead.  But this place is easier at accommodating a massively sized group without a fixed menu.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The old adage, you get what you pay for fits here! Expensive but what a treat! One of the best steaks I have ever eaten! Service was amazing and the chef even came out to check on us. There are simply not enough superlatives for this place!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Great customer service but not so great steaks .  My husband ordered the $50 bone in rib eye and it was soo chewy and full of fat .  I ordered New York steak and it was okay for $60.  I rather go to Mastro where it beats all the steakhouse restaurants I ever been to.  Don't waste your money and time here.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Just went last night. Still THE BEST steak any of our party had ever enjoyed...and it's consistently at that level. excellent service; just a GREAT way to enjoy a vegas evening before hitting the clubs, tables or whatever else is on the agenda.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Fantastic experience. It was our third wedding anniversary. The wait staff was excellent and the Chateaubriand was incredible. The French Onion soup was to die for. I would highly recommend this place, especially for a special occasion.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] went for a bachelor party dinner in oct 08...so amazing! service could not have been any better. sides were amazing, but if you get the rib eye..you wont need them. manager came to our party to make sure everything was as we liked. very impressive.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We were seated promptly for our 5:30 p.m. reservation on Monday, 12/29/2014. Front of house service was exceptional. The food took a while to make it to the table, which was a little surprising as the restaurant was not busy. My wife loved her filet. My bone in ribeye was good, but by far not the best I've had. The meat was over fatty. The sides were very tasty, including the asparagus and the twice baked potato. I would go again, but I'd order the filet instead of the ribeye.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Best. Steak. Ever. \n",
      "You pay for it, but that's expected at a high class restaurant. \n",
      "Service is exceptional... Food is off the chart!!\n",
      "Would definitely return when I'm back in town.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] While on an extended stay at the Palazzo we decided to try Delmonico. I made a reservation through Open Table. We were seated promptly but at a table that was less than desirable where the waiter had to stand behind me while serving us. He was quite pushy and brusque. My wife ordered the half duck as she loves duck. Right after we were served the waiter returned and asked if everything was OK, My wife had taken one bite from the duck leg and she said that things were OK. But as she continued to work on the rest of the duck it seemed to become very tough like it had been over microwaived. She signaled the waiter over and rather than handling it professionally he asked in a rather accusing manner why she had said the duck was OK when first asked. This made us feel very uncomfortable. The waiter did remove the duck and did not charge us for it. However, we just wanted some excellent food. I'll never return to any of Emeril's restaurants based on this encounter. If you want a good meal while at the Venetian / Palazzo go to Bouchon where you'll be treated well and the food is great. Just to be balanced I will say that the rib eye that I had was good.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I liked this place a lot and would probably go here again next time I'm in Vegas.  They have a nice bar/lounge to hang out in if you have to wait for a table.  Very good food and very professional staff.  The presentation when you order an expensive bottle of wine is pretty amazing.  Not quite 5 stars though.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] It was a real up and down evening.\n",
      "Apps - BBQ shrimp were great but there's only 4 of them so don't expect to get filled up.\n",
      "Entrees - my wife had the filet medallions and they were basically disgusting. They were terrible cuts of meat and she was only able to eat about half of it. I had the bone in ribeye which was fine but nothing spectacular.\n",
      "Sides - we had the creamed corn which I thought was terrific, my wife not so much. The potatoes gratin were good but you better like parmesan if you order them. \n",
      "Dessert - the greatest piece of banana creme pie I've ever had, and it's monsterous!! \n",
      "Drinks - They didn't have the bacon and bourbon manhattan but the bartender said we weren't missing anything....so why keep it on the menu? Anyway, to finish off the night I had a Dusk in the Burroughs which is just about the perfect after dinner drink. That and the banana creme pie were easily the best things we had the entire evening. \n",
      "\n",
      "The service was top notch and they took the medallions off the bill and also comped the pie, all without my wife saying anything more than she wasn't impressed with the steak. \n",
      "In the end the start was good and finish was fantastic, but with the steaks being so bad it really took away from the whole experience. At roughly $50 a steak we just expect way way better, and with so many fine dining options in Vegas it's tough to see us going back anytime soon. Maybe eventually, but it'll be a while if we do.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The food here is pretty good but the reason I'm giving 3 stars is because I personally don't think it's any better than a Ruth's Chris, which is half the cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "What stood out the most was the lobster bisque. It was really good! But everything else wasn't better what I could have gotten at Ruth's Chris, especially not the banana cream pie which was worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "My advice, save your money and go to Ruth's Chris or another restaurant.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I don't even know where to begin.  I had my first chef's table experience EVER here and IT WAS BEYOND AMAZING!!!  It was quite pricey, but it was a very memorable dinner to say the least.  I truly felt special being lead to a private room  in the kitchen of the restaurant to dine with good company!  We had blinds to cover our space from the rest of the restaurant, even had our own music in our own room!  Being able to peer into the kitchen and watch the staff prep and cook while we eat alone already had a super cool factor to it!!!  I highly recommend it for anyone that is willing to splurge on a nice private wine and dinner pairing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our chef (Chef Erwin) and sommelier (Dylan) for the night were fantastic and every course/pairing I had was an absolute delight to my tasting palette.  Some of my favorites from the night were the truffle and parmesan chips, pork chops, steak, and dessert (esp the banana cream pie, and chocolate decadence cake, butter cake, and flan!).  I'm sure whoever your chef is for the night won't disappoint.  This chef's table beyond exceeded my expectations and I couldn't be happier to recommend this experience to anyone.  Dooooo it!!!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This is a great place for steak!  I love the red meat and this was on par with the best I've had.  Not quite as flashy as some of the other steak joints, but who cares when the food is great.  We had some apps to start: chips were awesome and the tartar was fantastic.  Moving on to the bone in Ribeye was a 10. It was cooked to perfection and the crust from the sear was just right.  A little bit of butter on top and wala perfection.  The wine list is pretty comprehensive as well.  Prices were surprisingly reasonable.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My friends hyped this place up so much this time in Vegas that I walked in with super high expectations, which unfortunately did not hold.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the service was great, so were the breads, their cocktails were nothing to write home about and their wine selection was rigid - I had the Hemingway drink and it was alright.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food was good - I had the tuna which was really good on itself, but the sauce was terrible. The sides were not bad. Our server really hyped up the creamed corn, which came much later and I did not see what the big deal was about. It was again just ok.\n",
      "\n",
      "The desserts were pretty good, our table enjoyed them. I ordered the bread pudding ala mode and having had the some spectacular bread puddings recently, I did not think this was anything amazing but still not bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing to mention though - because our server had forgotten our last side order, it was on the house. tells you alot about the quality of service at this place.\n",
      "\n",
      "I probably will try out other options on the strip before coming back here. Given that it's Vegas, there are some really good options. Unfortunately Delmonico wasn't a super memorable experience for me, but for a well-made dinner in a nice restaurant, this place is spot on.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Awesome food! \n",
      "Got the steak salad for my lunch and it was perfect!! \n",
      "The steak was prepared very well and i enjoyed very much. \n",
      "I got to taste the lobster slider which was lovely as well. Wished the portion was larger though. It only comes with two tiny sliders. \n",
      "The service was quite slow. Getting to be seated and the waiter to show up on the table took a while.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Every year a group of us (we had 6 this year) goes to Vegas and tries out the various high end restaurants (and one night it's always a steakhouse).\n",
      "\n",
      "This year we chose Delmonico's Steakhouse.  We enjoyed a seafood tower to start (fantastic) and for the main courses a few shared the Chateaubriand (\"it was unbelievable!\") and others had the Ahi Tuna (\"excellent!\").  \n",
      "\n",
      "In short - it was an excellent meal!  The service was top notch, the food was great and we would all strongly recommend it.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Came back here with in a month just to show my wife the deliciousniss of the lobster bisque...it was just as good the 2nd time...too bad during lunch..they don't give the lobster as  a garnish as they do during dinner.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Lunch service was ok...you can tell the difference from the dinner service.  But the food was good still.  I did want to try the lobster sliders....some one else go that and it looked pretty good...you get 2 sliders.  I had the pasta dish during lunch but the flavors was a bit bland and the dish was forgetable.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Service and food were worth the $200 bill for 2.  My husband and I chose the Delmonico for our Wedding night dinner last month.  We had a champagne toast, the chef sent out complimentary bisque as a wedding gift and sorbet after the meal. My husband ordered the Filet Mignon and I ordered the pecan encrusted chicken breast.  We splurged (I rarely order dessert) and shared a piece of chocolate cake.  Everyone was pleasant but with an air of regal you would expect in an upscale restaurant.\n",
      "The only complaint was the table next to us having a serious religious conversation during what should have been a pleasureable friday evening.  We made the best of it though and had a few jokes to keep ourselves entertained...\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The restaurant looks like it needs an upgrade. The finishes are starting to wear and the bathrooms were not nicely appointed. The restaurant was nicely spread out, though. Tables were spaced so there was plenty of room to move and afforded some privacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food, unfortunately, was mediocre. I opted for the pork chops at medium temperature. They were tasty, but very overdone and dry. The appetizers and salads were lovely, though.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Service was great, the NY Strips were very fatty which is why I'm giving 3 instead of 4 stars. I only ate a few bites but stopped because it was so fatty.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My wife wanted to take me to a special place for my 50th birthday, and she chose Delmonico.  Overall, it was a bit of a disappointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food:\n",
      "We started off with the shrimp, which was wonderful, and the bread was warm and soft.  It was a bit salty for my taste, but that's just me.  We then had the spinach salad, which was wonderful!  For entrees, I had the crab stuffed lobster and the wife had the filet.  The lobster was great; the filet was nothing special.  For dessert, we had a sorbet and the cheesecake; both were quite good.\n",
      "\n",
      "The waiters/staff:\n",
      "If I had to use one word, it would be disinterested. The waiter was good, but the other (why were there two?) just seemed to be reading a script and literally had to read his notes on the available dessert flavors.  The wife had informed them it was my 50th birthday, but when the dessert came out it said \"Happy Anniversary\".  We jokingly noted the error and the waiter said we didn't appear to be old enough to be married for 50 years, but he went with what he was told.  We didn't blame him at all and left a generous tip. This error underscore their lack of attention and appearance of just going through the motions.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, overall, it was OK, but not great.  We've had better steaks, and FAR better service (Ferraro's Italian Restaurant waiter was the BEST) for much less cost.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] One of the best meals of my life. Gumbo,  Filet, oliver style was delectable.  A nice 2010 bottle of wine from emerils own collection.  White choco macadamia nut  bread pudding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh and the twice baked potato was like silk!\n",
      "\n",
      "Service was great too, very attentive.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I agree with all the raves regarding the food however the restaurant itself lacks any real ambiance. Tucked away on the first floor of The Venitian we were disappointed by lack of personality given the location,  Vegas, and being so highly rated. Food, of course,  was excellent.  Loved my wilted spinach salad and the bone in ribeye was terrific.  Just anticipated more of a dining experience.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] TIP ON ORDERING STEAK:\n",
      "If you want a bigger cut of meat, get it rare to medium-rare.  \n",
      "Otherwise, if you order your meat medium-well, you get a smaller cut in order for it to cook well in the middle\n",
      "\n",
      "I couldn't decide on a steak that night, and I wanted a little variety.  So I ordered a combination of 2 appetizers and a soup.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soup: Lobster bisque was awesome mainly because they weren't stingy with the lobster meat.  Often when you order a seafood soup (e.g. clam chowder) they dump a lot of potatoes or other filling in there.  Not the case with this bisque.  A must for any bisque or lobster connoisseur.\n",
      "\n",
      "Appetizer 1: Butternut squash ravioli w/duck was very tasty, and again, not stingy with the duck, which kind of looked like pulled pork but with duck meat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Appetizer 2: Crawfish meat w/Crystal pepper sauce over linguine could have been a small meal in itself.  And just the right amount of that Crystal Hot Sauce to give it a solid Southern kick.  This was probably my favorite.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did have a taste of the various meats too including the T-bone and filet mignon, both of which I recommend.  You don't get anything with it, so unless you just want meat, you'll probably need to order a side dish or two.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I don't think I could have found a more perfect place to celebrate my birthday! \n",
      "\n",
      "After an amazing experience in December, I was so pleased to hear we would be going back for my birthday! I decided that this time around I would try out something besides steak. I knew they had steak down pat, but if this were truly an Emeril place, I knew I had to check out the other menu selections. So this time around we enjoyed the artisanal cheeses to start and I had the shrimp with fettuccini with olive oil. My husband enjoyed a trio of filet mignon medallions. The pasta was perfectly cooked, not overly dressed in sauce with the shrimp cooked to exactly the right temperature.  My husband's filets were also perfectly done and the sauces that adorned the medalions were amazing. Truly amazing. We shared the potatoes au gratin and of course, these were just as heavenly as I remembered from our first visit. \n",
      "\n",
      "For dessert, we shared the chocolate root beer float. The root beer was Abita, made in Louisiana. It was mild in flavor yet refreshingly delicious. I could swear that the chocolate ice cream was house made though I don't know that for a fact. It was sooooo refreshing and just the right way to top off our meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love Delmonico. It is by far my favorite restaurant in Vegas. I can't wait to go back. One day I hope to meet Emeril and hug him for making such wonderful food.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Yes!! The food and service were incredible. Our server Michael J was top notch. Exactly what you want when dining at a fine steak house. Watching Michael and his team work was like a well choreographed show.  The steaks were cooked perfectly, appetizers great, salads also very good. Well done guys! We will be back.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The bone in ribeye was freakin delicious!  I am glad had a good experience at my first Emeril restaurant.  Hopefully my next one will be Commanders Palace in 2 years.  woot woot.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I really wanted to love this place, but honestly...well...\n",
      "For starters, I was a single, attractive woman, dining alone when there was a giant computer convention at the Venetian. Why oh why would you seat me in a dark, partitioned corner??\n",
      "Then my dirty martini came, and it was...warm. \n",
      "And my iceberg wedge salad was tasty, but soggy. \n",
      "My bone-in ribeye was enormous and glorious, but not exactly warm. \n",
      "And my tawny port looked awfully ruby. \n",
      "All in all my experience was uninspired.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Last time I ate at this fine establishment, I uttered the words, \"This is the best meal of my life.\"  I got this Linguine with pesto, chicken and pine nuts (yes I know, I ordered pasta at a steakhouse), but it was well worth it!  Emeril knows what he's doing no matter what the dish you order.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Their tartar is absolutely fantastic as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Service is unlike nothing I've ever experienced.  Even though it's pricey and fancy, even if you can get here just once in your life, it's worth it!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "PS - Good beers and wines!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] bone in rib eye steak is the popular choice it's corn fed rather than grass fed (piedmontese = italian leaner import).  overall solid with flavor and cooking temp although some were not pleased\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] World class service.  Tasteful decor.  2400 selection wine list.  And the very best bananna cream pie ever made.\n",
      "\n",
      "While our Bordeaux decanted, the artisinal cheese plate was a perfect appetizer, as was the grilled shrimp with black truffle special.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Lobster bisque was grand.  The gumbo 100% authentic.  Her crab stuffed lobster tail was heavenly.  My bone-in ribeye was simply perfect.. We loved the creamed corn gratin.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then it was time for dessert.\n",
      "\n",
      "This dinner was my 4th time at an Emeril Lagasse property since my first visit to his flagship restaurant in New Orleans almost 20 years ago.  For all that time I've been telling her about Emeril's bananna cream pie, while I made it for her from one of his cookbooks.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now she's had the real thing and agrees it really is the best she's ever tasted. Her comment to our kids said it all: \"at least Dad tried.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With a very special wine, $800 for two.  We will return.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I usually only Yelp a location when I either have something negative to say (sad but true) or when I think I'm being witty. lol \n",
      "\n",
      "Today, for what I think is the first time, I'm Yelping because I'm just so incredibly impressed. EVERYTHING was delicious. Amazing. My husband got the bone in rib eye and I got the filet mignon.... so good. Sides were twice baked potato (better than my mom's, sorry mom) and cream corn. Literally some of the best food I've ever had. Great service too. \n",
      "\n",
      "Expensive, yes. But very well worth it. :)\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Amazing service, even better food, I can't imagine how this could ever get less than five stars unless people don't like the prices. We spent $260 for three and we did not have dessert or drinks, and I'm ok with that. Every bite was fabulous and the servers were unbeatable.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Hands down the best meal and service I have ever had! We all did the three course special which was great and the portions were triple the size what I thought they would be! Michael and Drew were awesome waiters and made sure everything was perfect. I know my family will talk about that night for years to come!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The bone-in rib eye is easily the highlight of this steakhouse. The medium rare steak had excellent flavor along with the marbled fat that simply melted in my mouth. The oysters, ahi tuna & salmon tartare, butternut squash ravioli, and bbq shrimp are all excellent choices for starters and the potato gratin is a good side dish to have the steak with. The wine list is very extensive, but if you're not up for all that intensive reading, they also have a very knowledgeable staff to make recommendations. I was a little disappointed with peppermint profiteroles which were a little too stiff for my liking. Service was great and efficient. I must have had my water glass filled 7-8 times that night. Pricing is relatively decent - entrees around $50 and starters/sides/deserts around $10-$15 each.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The food was average at best.  The exceptionally high prices and the quality of the dishes do not match up.  Wife and I chose Delmonico based on reviews.  We left disappointed. The service is what you would expect to find at any high end restaurant.  All of our dishes lacked flavor and the quality of the ingredients were not there as well.  I am really not sure how this place is so well reviewed.  Coming from Boston we could go out every night for three months for a fantastic dinner and never revisit the same restaurant.  With that maybe we are spoiled.  Our bill for the two of us at the end of the night was $250.  Being generous I would say that dinner was worth maybe a third of the cost.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The next night we sat at the bar at Seablue in the MGM for a couple of cocktails. I got talking with the bartender and told him about dinner the previous night.  He said \"ooh, I wouldn't go there.  I was there years ago and found it to be extremely overpriced and the food just not that good.  I've heard lots of people say not great things about their Delmonico visit.\" Coincidentally, if you are in the MGM during happy hour visit the Seablue. Shrimp Cocktail are $1 each and are huge.  Coming from the east coast I wouldn't eat shrimp in the desert but on the bartenders recommendation we got some. They were excellent.\n",

      "If the restaurant wasn't in the Venetian and visited by thousands of tourists I would guess it would go out of business rather quickly.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I've eaten here twice, it was better a few years back. The steak wasn't that great quality in general for the steak. The sides and salads were excellent. I'm kind of upset that they share the name with the fantastic steakhouse Emeril owns in New Orleans.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant while I was visiting Vegas with my fiance. We were staying at the Venetian and this location is conveniently located within the beautiful hotel so it was an easy choice for dinner. It is definitely nice not having to step outside of the AC when the average temperature outside is 115! \n",
      "\n",
      "I got the caesar salad to start and filet mignon for the main dish. Some of the side items we got were spinach, asparagus, wild mushrooms, and creamed corn gratinee. The main dishes do not come with sides so they are extra but the portions are large enough to share. \n",
      "\n",
      "I asked for my filet mignon to be medium rare and it was done perfectly. The steak was so tender and delicious! It was definitely one of the best steaks I have had. The sides complimented the meat nicely and everything single one of them were delicious. I wish I could comment on their deserts but we were both so full by the end of the meal that we decided to skip desert. This restaurant is a must if you are in Vegas!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Terrific service from a friendly and professional team. Food was great. Cesar salad made table-side was a treat. Steaks delicious and perfectly cooked. All sides were really good, especially the creamed spinach: which actually tasted like spinach in cream sauce -- not the gloop one sometimes get. A special shout out to the sommelier, Dylan, who was engaging and informative and did not blink when we asked for a reasonably priced bottle of wine. The only glitch was we waited a bit longer than expected to have our drink orders taken when we first sat down. Overall a terrific meal.\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] So me and my wife went here for our 20th wedding anniversary. It was Valentine's and I had made the reservation online. Well, we got all dressed up (for us,lol) and arrived about a minute or two before or 530 pm reservation and were seated within a couple minutes. The ambiance was great! Just what I was hoping for on this special night. So we peruse the menu and I decided to get the bone in ribeye and my wife selected the bone in NY strip. Both of which were touted as dry aged. We also got the buttered broccoli and potatoes augrautin. \n",
      " It took a good 30 minutes for our food to come out and were given 2 pieces of bread which were light and tasty. The servers waiting our table did an excellent job of keeping our water topped off. And when our food was ready a small army of servers marched up and placed everything almost simultaneously. They all were impeccably dressed and very attentive and polite. \n",
      " Well, now to the really disappointing part which is also the most important. The food. I'm a foodie. And in particular a steak connoisseur. This was in my opinion the worst dry aged steak I've ever had. Not even to mention at this price point. I've had better steaks at any number of chain restaurants. It came drenched in a marinade and was full of gristle. I honestly believe we were served a cheap choice or select cut instead of dry aged prime for which we paid. The sides were OK. But the steaks were bad. And when shelling out over $150 for it needs to be an amazing meal. Do I'm sorry to say I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone. And the only reason I didn't make a scene over the poor quality of our steaks was I was try desperately to salvage our special dinner. \n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I got a chance to enjoy Delmonico Steakhouse during LV Restaurant Week. We went there for lunch and I'll take some of the blame for the experience because I ordered a a burger instead of a specialty, but it could have been better. It would have been nice to have someone ask me how to prepare it to my liking. Other than that, the staff was great and I had my very first piece of pecan pie there. I may go back again, but I'd have to be convinced.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This was my best meal of the week during a week of great meals in Las Vegas.  Delmonico's is Emeril LaGasse's take on a modern American steakhouse.  For my money, Emeril nails it.  The service here was excellent.  The atmosphere was American classic.  The noise level was moderate.  We were able to have a very good conversation where the whole table of 6 was engaged the entire time.  The cocktail menu was imaginative and the Old Fashioned's tasted nearly as good as mine.  The wine list was interesting and navigated well by one of my work colleagues.  The popovers to start as the bread option was a nice touch.  Popovers were \"a thing\" in my youth, my Mom loved them, and for me it's always sweet to have them in a restaurant.  For my entree I had the filet mignon and it was perfect.  Others in our party had the bone in rib eye and the bone in sirloin ... all were happy.  We ordered 3/4 of the sides on the menu and all were well done.   We all ordered dessert and 1/2 the table went with the banana cream pie and the other 1/2 with key lime, both were good, but the key lime was the winner.  The net-net for this Yelper is that I would be happy to go back here anytime.  Delmonico rates 5 stars and two thumbs up.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Being from California where foie gras is banned, I was on a foie gras mission..,The foie gras appetizer with apples was amazing!!! It was so good we ordered a second plate eventhough I had a side of foie gras with my filet mignon coming. I ordered my filet mignon medium rare and asked that it not be too salty...but it still came salty :( I only ate about half of it. But the simple seared foie gras was delicious. Will come back for more of the appetizer!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] After three years of waiting, I finally found myself back to Delmonico Steakhouse. Why did I come here out of all the other excellent steak houses on the Las Vegas strip?\n",
      "\n",
      "1 reason: Truffle Parmesan potato chips. they are like crack, you simply can't stop eating them :)\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the Certified Piedmontese steak, NY Strip steak ($60), grilled in olive oil, sea salt, roasted garlic and rosemary. At 16 ounces, each tender bite was worth every dollar.\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Amazing does not explain how great this dinner was!  My wife and I were there to celebrate our anniversary, which eating at a fine dining steakhouse is becoming the annual tradition.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I had made a reservation, and when we arrived, we were greeted numerous times from several different people offering congratulations on our anniversary.  This made everything seem special for my wife, who had no idea we were coming here.  Then we were taken to our table.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were given a near endless wine list (book!) and expected to decide from there?  No, the sommelier came over and determined our wine for us, and did not pick the most expensive bottle, but one of the best ones we have had, for way less than the next closest we had drank a while back.\n",
      "\n",
      "The menu is not too over the top, but just right.  I wanted to have the escargot, but my wife cannot bring herself to eat this, so we had the BBQ shrimp.  Being from Texas, we love barbeque, but this was different, and superb.  Four huge shrimp covered in a sauce that I have never had the likes of before.  Our main entrée was the Chateaubriand cooked tableside.  I enjoy my steak rare to med-rare, but my wife does not like to see blood in her steak. (I know, I'm working on this)  They were able to cook the same piece of meat to my liking as well as hers and it came out perfect.  Not a thing was left on either of our plates. \n",
      "\n",
      "We concluded the meal with two desserts, I had Emeril's banana cream pie.  An incredible end to a wonderful meal.  My wife had the crème bruele,  and explained it in details I have never heard her use to explain food.  On top of this, we were given a small sample of sorbet with a happy anniversary not written in chocolate on the plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were so many waiters and helpers taking care of our every need that it was almost impossible to say who was the actual waiter, although the main waiter was superb.  He took over for the cook at our table because he knew exactly how we wanted the steak, and never did he let anything sit out of place, no drink ran low, and not one thing was missed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, amazing can not explain how great this meal was.  We will definitely stop again next time we are in Vegas!\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew how much it would be before we went, but for the sake of a review, I will say our meal for two was right at $300, but well worth it.  If you are looking for a fine dining restaurant and not wanting to spend this much, then you aren't really looking for fine dining.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We were disappointed. Went there for anniversary dinner... There was no Bam, no kicking it up a notch, just kind of taste-free. Although we had three people assigned to the table the service was slow. After dropping the menus it took a while to take our drink order, and then a while longer to get them. but then we got the food before we finished the cocktail. OK. The main complaint is that the food just wasn't that good. Foie gras to start was OK, the wife had the filet and I had buffalo ribeye.  I knew buffalo is iffy, whether you get meat or gristle, but the waiter assured me it was not gamey. Well, this one didn't change my mind--the center was good but I had to do a lot of chewing to get to it. The filet was chewy and really had no taste to it. Creamed spinach had a definite cream taste, but where was the BAM? Same thing with twice baked potatoes--too liquid. To finish we had the espresso creme brulee, which was good, but too cold; with chocolate madelines that were not warm, and again, tasteless.  Just not worth the price we paid at all. I mean I've had better steak at Outback. Sorry Emeril.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Delmonico serves up superb cuts of meat!  I'd recommend going with the bone-in ribeye... so tender, juicy, and flavorful!  And don't skimp on the sides, order at least 2-3 even if it's just for a party of 2.  I loved the caesar salad.  There's something nice about slicing your own leaves of romaine in a salad.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service here is nice and efficient.  It's what you would expect when dining at a restaurant of this calibre.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Let me start by saying I don't  eat red meat but I decided to try Delmonico Steakhouse because I knew  the other proteins and veggies would be delicious and I knew all the other people in our group would love it. I was not disappointed at all....the halibut was perfect.  Veggie on the table were severed family style which made it easy to share and try everything: mushrooms, broccoli, asparagus, mashed potatoes, twice baked potato, and regular baked potato.  The mushrooms were my personal favorite but everything was great. Other proteins  on our table: pork chop, rack of lamb, ribeye, NY strip, and filet mignon, while I didn't try them everyone in our group loved their dish, nothing but happy faces in our party. The service was stellar and the pop overs were mouth-wateringly delicious.  Also had the bbq shrimp appetizer and truffle potato chips both were great not a crumb left on the plate. Cocktail wise the Dorian Gray was sweet with a bit of punch at the end, I loved it. Overall I would love to return to Delmonico and perhaps leave room for dessert next time!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] One of the best meals we've ever had.  the staff was very friendly, the prices a bit high but worth it.  We got the chicken, the shrimp pasta and the the petite beef medallions.  The chicken tasted a little gamey to me but the shrimp pasta and the beef medallions were great.  the portions were also reasonable.  We didn't drink or order any appetizers but 3 entrees and the meal was about $150 total.  Not bad for a wonderful meal for 3 ppl.  One of the best meals I've ever had and I've been to a lot of Emeril's places and this is the best by far.  Gotta go.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Emeril is a liar. The beef that he serves is in no way USDA Prime. Or at least it wasn't on the night we dined there. I have had my share of prime cuts of beef and one thing they are not is tough. Especially a rib-eye. Our steak was not only tough, but flavorless and mealy as well.\n",
      "I really wanted to like this place. My husband and I sat at the bar and had great service from the bartender. We split the rib-eye because who in the heck can eat a whole one of those? It was perfectly cooked. Cutting into it was another matter. It took effort. The consistency was mealy, and without one of the three sauces they offer with it, was completely flavorless. I think Emeril is trying to pawn off a lesser grade of beef on poor unsuspecting tourists, some of who he thinks do not know any better. Shame on him. \n",
      "To know what a real USDA Prime cut of beef is head down the road to Ruth's Chris Steak House.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This place was really great.  There was no wait when my girlfriend and i went here, we have reservations anyway.  We never really had to wait long for anything because we had 3 waiters helping us.  They had really good bread to start off with and they made the best tasting whisky sour i've ever had from their bar.  I got the new york strip steak and it filled me up and tasted great.  it was a very quiet place too, most of the people there were older and drinking wine.  i'd go back if i ran into a lot of money, but i'm content with $12 steak.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] tl;dr - You can do much much better.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I was actually kind of shocked by this place.  I had heard good things, but was disappointed at virtually every turn:\n",
      "\n",
      "Appearance - the place is falling apart.  tiles falling out of walls, holes in walls, dirty bathrooms, uncomfortable and awkward seating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service - mediocre.  Had to ask repeatedly for items, waiter disappeared for 20+ minutes at a time.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Food - decent; worthy of a 3 star, but the rest drags the rating down.  My filet was cooked to order and seasoned well.  When I ask for anchovies for my caesar salad though, I don't mean 'the anchovy paste you use in the dressing is adequate.'  It means I would like actual anchovies.  This isn't rocket surgery, delmonico.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, anywhere else this would have rated a 3 star experience, but given both the price (in general, and relative to other steakhouses in vegas), and the sheer overabundance of steakhouses per capita in LV, there's no way this should rate highly on anyone's list.   Bad form, Delmonico.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We had to come back here again on our most recent visit to Vegas. It was as good as we remember it. The lobster bisque, filet, and chocolate soufflé did not disappoint. The only minor complaint I have this time is with the cocktails. Too much ice and no garnish. For the type of restaurant it is, it should also not be using regular ice cubes from an ice machine. The drinks should not only taste good, but look delicious as well. \n",
      "I would not hesitate to come back here.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Ok, this would have to be one of my favorites!! The food is delicious and wine as well. But seriously, nothing can beat the service at Delmonico's. We had 2 servers and they were both soooo attentive to everything we needed.  Hands down best steakhouse in Vegas, if not best restuarant. Highly, highly recommend reservations.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] It's been at least a year and half since i hit delmonico's - i wanted to try CUT but the person that invited me and was flipping the bill, chose the bam guy's steakhouse and since i was free loadin' - all good with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "ate around 6 - started with a fat tire ale, then a sauvignon blanc - both hit the spot after the heated drive. ordered the bone-in rib eye with blue cheese melted on top - medium ( i believe it costs $52 - i didn't have my reading glasses - difficult to read ! ) twice baked potato,( $9) asparagus ($8)  and the gumbo of the day ( $10)\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Came out for our anniversary, the steaks were wonderful HUGE cuts if you want to spend money on this Restaurant, then this will be the place to do so.

      "warning:  optimal for big eaters...wow!  below are the items I tried, ratings out of 5:\n",
      "\n",
      "- (3) new Orleans rouge cocktail - rye whiskey & pomegranate: nice, potent, simple, but had a tad bit of the cough syrup taste. I guess it didn't have real pomegranate juice.\n",
      "- (4) complementary amuse bouche - crostini, cheese, balsamic vinaigrette: a pleasant surprise treat, a nice 2-bite start.\n",
      "- (5) truffle & parmesan potato chips:  crispy, oily, & flaky cheesy goodness!  plenty to share.\n",
      "- (4.5) rib eye (no bone):  cooked perfectly medium rare, lots of flavor, no need for any jus.  however, I couldn't get my mind out of the other 2 steaks I tasted...the bone-in NY strip & the bone-in filet...wow!  bone-in is definitely the way to go...\n",
      "- (3) creamed spinach, potato gratin, & grilled asparagus:  our side choices were pretty average, but loved how the portions are sized for sharing.\n",
      "- (5) EXCELLENT SERVICE!  everything was a presentation...from the mention of specials, answers to questions, they announced the highlighted ingredients for every plate and cocktail they put down.  magnificent!\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish I knew the portions were big enough to share.  I had to throw away half my steak...boo!  no room for dessert.  definitely coming back to share my steak this time so I can try the dessert options.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Yes I love this place and I want to go again and again.   The value is also very good and where it should be.   Note to all: The pork chop is now called \"Ham Chop\", it's still my favorite item on the menu and I think the country's best piece of swine.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I've been here once about 10 years ago.... didn't have a good experience... therefore was a little hesitant to try it again... but WOW!! this time it was completely different! Gotta get the rib eye here! Bone in or bone out... doesn't matter. Both really good. All the sides were also fantastic. If I had to pick one the mushrooms would probably be my favorite. The creamed corn was also really really good. Mashed potatoes good but not your socks off like the other things.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Oh.  My.  Lord.  Best steak I've ever had, super tender and tasty even though relatively unadorned.  I thought Mesa Grill was good (and it is) but this hunk of cow takes the cake.  The ambiance is nice although the decor is a bit spartan, the wine list is far more than my gin-drinking brain could ever comprehend, and to top it all off the service was on another level:  There were like three dudes running around bringing us stuff and clearing plates all night.  And you wanna know about attention to detail?  The one thing Vegas has heretofore *never* gotten right was the after-dinner espresso.  Never hot enough, or no head of crema, or just awful tasting.  But Delmonico's brew was not only good tasting, but they actually warmed up the cup!  (The coffee snobs among you will know what I'm on about here.)\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] its about on par with craft steak...the sides were ok...the prime rib was superb...me likey\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Everything we expected in a celebrity chef steakhouse and more. The service was absolutely top notch. This ties with the best service I've ever had and is second to none from my experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "We don't have a lot of experience with wines and there was no hint of pretense or haughtiness from the staff and we felt very welcome and enjoyed the experience. The dress code was casual with no jacket and tie required.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have a huge selection of cocktails and wines and we received friendly and helpful assistance in finding a wine to our liking and were immediately offered an alternative after the first selection didn't exactly meet my wife's liking. \n",
      "\n",
      "The bone-in ribeye was perfect and I was very pleased with the Cajun seasoning used there (Emeril's). My wife had the rack of lamb and was very pleased with it. The pieces were very meaty. \n",
      "\n",
      "The twice baked potato is HUGE and would be easy to share. The vegetable selections are also served with plenty to share so ordering one entrée for each person in a couple with a single potato and single vegetable would work sell. \n",
      "\n",
      "I can also recommend the crème Brule which had fresh fruit on top and was a very nice dessert to share.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Delmonico är kända för sina stekar och det var precis det jag beställde. Deras signatur stek \"Bone-in Ribeye\" för $55. Jag slogs direkt över hur pass gigantisk den var. Utan tvivel var det den fetaste och största steken jag har ätit, och även för mig som brukar sluka stekar utan som helst problem tog det lite tid och krävdes skicklighet att få ned den. Som tur är var den fullkomligt gudomlig och tillagad precis som jag älskar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Till detta tog jag en sidobeställning på krämig spenat som var relativt standard, och inget speciellt och en förrätt som var löksoppan, och den var faktiskt riktigt god och hade en intressant tvist om att osten låg på insidan av soppan och inte var helt smält på toppen, det gillades skarpt. \n",
      "\n",
      "När det kommer till desserten var Delmonico lite busiga och erbjöd \"Creme Brulée på ankägg\" och det smakade faktiskt inte annorlunda alls, så det var lite tråkigt att jag föll för den. Den var förövrigt inte särskild imponerande ens. \n",
      "\n",

Some have titles as \"the best steak house on the north end of town\". Any time a variable is add to the title I usually questions it. But when I found we had seats at This place I went to google. \n",

      "First thing i noticed is the low lighting and Elegant atmosphere. First glance you would think this place is strictly for high rollers with a private jet parked across the street. However it wasn't a strict dress code.  I saw customers with  tailored suits as we'll as shorts and polo shirts. My suggestion would be to step it up a little bit simply because you are in Vegas. \n",
      "\n",
      "I will not talk about the price of the meal because when I used Yelp to checking I got a high rollers badge. That means his place is very expensive. Let's just say it was 12 of us and the bill was over $1200 dollars. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered a drink called \"THE BRONTE SISTERS\" that came to the table in a mid Evil looking copper glass. Then I order another and another. Best drink I've ever had. Beware there isn't any prices on the drink menu but these babies run about 16 bucks. Yikes (disclaimer: I had a good day at the crap tables so I could splurge a bit) \n",

      "For started I ordered an Emeril Lagasse BBQ Shrimp with fresh baked Rosemary biscuit. The biscuits was very small but so freaking tasteful. After all the shrimp was devoured I was left with this amazing sauce on the bottom of the plate. If I didn't care if people looked at me like a homeless man with his first meal I would've licked the plate. No lie it was that good.  When the waiter took my plate with all that sauce left I felt like i violated a crime in flavor town. \n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Always on the hunt for the perfect steakhouse I took up some Yelp recommendations and gave this place a try. We were a party of 6 and truth be told we were running on fumes from the prior evenings festivities (how strange...in vegas??) so this review is based on our less than average appetites. Although we did order a lot more than we could manage to eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their most popular steak is probably the bone in rib-eye and it's a whopping 16 ounces (without bone)...quite hefty and although the steak was cooked to perfection it was definitely under seasoned. It also seemed mine had a bit more fat than usual which is as we know is where all the flavour is but it seemed perhaps a bit too much. All the sides were awesome and their meant to be shared family style... definitely try the garlic mushrooms!\n",

      "We ordered the gnocchi w/ black truffles to start ($25).  For my entree I had a bone-in ribeye w/ foie gras ($72 - $52 for the steak & $20 for the foie gras), my friend had the regular ribeye ($48), and on the side we had haricot vert almondine ($11) & fingerling potatoes ($12).  \n",
      "\n",
      "The gnocchi was very good.  It had a nice crisp and the truffles accented the taste of the potatoes in the gnocchi very well:  4 Stars.  Unfortunately, the steak was not very good.  It was fatty, chewy in some spots and not that flavorful.  The waiter stated that Delmonico's has the best steaks in town.  Sorry, but I have had better steaks at STK and T-Bonz in Summerlin:  2 Stars.  The foie gras was OK.  It was nice to see it on the menu because you can't find it in CA.  However, I was expecting more crisp:  3 Stars.  The haricot vert was just OK too.  The beans were crispy and there were plenty of almonds, but other than that they were nothing to remember:  3 Stars.  Lastly, the fingerling potatoes were too salty, and I am one who generally doesn't notice when dishes are too salty.  The waiter Ken did offer to make a new batch, but the food took a long time to come out and we declined:  2 Stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "To accompany the meal we had a bottle of COS Pithos Rosso 2008 from Sicily ($85). The winery describes the wine as superbly elegant, subtly meaty w/ a cherry fruit nose.  The palate is profound:  Elegant, pure and mineral with lovely spice and earth notes.  Some complexity, and a bit of tannic structure.  OK, perhaps too much self-promotion, but Delmonico has an extensive wine list at many price points.  The wine was excellent and went very well w/ all the dishes:  5 Stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ambiance was sterile, but there was a good amount of space between the tables.  Unfortunately, the restrooms were lame.  It was quite a walk, there was no valet and only one stall and one urinal.  I had to wait and after I finished, the line was two deep:  2 Stars.  In addition, the service was not very good.  The entrees came at least 35 min after the first course.  Ken, our waiter never stopped by to check on us and let us know it would take a while.  He did redeem himself by agreeing to take the potatoes off the check.  However, he offered us a complimentary dessert and we chose expressos and my friend asked for sambuca also.  We were charged for the sambuca : XXX. If he didn't take the potatoes off the check, I would have given him 1 Star:  2 Stars.\n",

      "I will not return to Delmonico's the next time I am in Vegas, even though I can walk here from the Venetian where I always stay.

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] After eating at Delmonico, I seriously didn't want to eat for days! I ordered the bone-in ribeye and my my, it was humongous. I finished the whole thing (no, not the bone also). It was a really delicious piece of meat. It was cooked medium rare perfectly. As if the steak wasn't rich enough for us... we decided to add on the seared foie gras. Very good piece of fat! For the sides, we ordered the corn, cream of spinach, broccoli and buttered asparagus. Much needed to counter the meat. \n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I love Delmonico's, I really do.  But this past weekend, it just didn't measure up.  I should have gone with my gut and given CUT a try.  We started with drinks in the bar, which was fine.  Our table for seven was ready on time, which is always nice.  Unfortunately, our service was super average compared to what I've had in the past at Delmonico's and at other comparable high end steakhouses.  My husband and I shared a salad for an appetizer.  We let the server know this when we ordered and in the past, we've had this served on two separate plates in lieu of having to divide the salad at the table.  Unfortunately, we were given to salad plates and told we could split it ourselves.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I love a good filet, and unfortunately, my filet was very average.  It was cooked to my liking, medium rare, but it was served relatively cool, which made me think that our food was sitting for a while before it was served.  My mom ordered seared ahi tuna which was served completely cold.  The outer edges were completely cooled after the searing, which again, tells me that our food sat out for a while.  My husband and my brother both ordered bone-in rib-eyes.  When the food was served, they brought one rib-eye that had been split in two.  The server went back to the kitchen and they realized they made a mistake and brought out the other rib-eye, while using tongs to take the half from my husband's plate and added it to my brother's plate.  Rookie move, seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "My family doesn't eat a ton of cards, so for sides we ordered two servings of the mushrooms, broccoli, and corn for my niece.  The server kept pushing for us to order a starch, which we insisted we didn't want- very bizarre, it's not like we weren't running up a pretty hefty tab.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was my mom's birthday and I really thought Delmonico's would come through with an excellent experience.  The food was okay overall, but I really can't say that this meal met my expectations or anyone at our tables' expectations.  I've been to many Emeril restaurants, maybe they went through a recent management change??  I don't know, I wish I could explain the extremely average experience.\n",

For dinner what better choice then the dry aged in house ribeye?  For sides we enjoyed garlic mushrooms, asparagus, NOLA creamed spinach and for dessert I savored the a entire Emeril's banana cream pie slice (it was huge and delish). My co worker from Phoenix enjoyed the bone in filet and he ended his meal with  key lime pie which he also raved about. \n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This was supposed to be a very special dinner for 10 for my husband's 50th birthday. Four other couples flew in  from all over to celebrate with us and the first problem is that they seated us at a table for 9. The hostess called that morning and said 9, I corrected her and let her know there were 10 and she said she'd call me back by noon to confirm but I never heard back. Regardless, this Open Table reso said 10 so I didn't worry about it until we all sat down, realized we were one short, and had to get back up and go wait in the bar. \n",
      "When were seated at a proper table, the appetizers that I'd pre-ordered were sitting out on the table, including fried oysters which had gone ice cold and soggy (very gross). We had to ask for bread long after entrees were served and it was cold, mushy things that looked like they used to be popovers (I thought I'd remembered a wonderful bread service before...?) And so on with the poor service...\n",
      "I've eaten here before and service and food were five stars. But the bone-in ribeyes were bland and not well-marbled, the bone-in bacon was 100% bone-in fat (of course bacon is very fatty but there was NO meat to be found at all) and the service was severely lacking in detail and common meal planning skills. I could list all the issues but you get the picture. Very disappointing. The best part of the meal was the fresh oysters in the seafood tower, very fresh and delicious.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This is our 2nd time eating here and we simply love it. The food is delicate, the atmosphere is classy, and the service is excellent. They have a way of making you feel special. We ordered the summer trio that came with three courses. My husband had the NY strip steak cooked to perfection and I had the halibut. Our neighboring table ordered the seafood tower, which looked fabulous. Next time, I'll have the seafood tower for $130! It will be worth the experience.\n",

      "\n",
      "Steaks - OK 3 Stars.  The only reason I rated three starts for the review.  If you are a patron of New York steakhouses such as Peter Lugers or S and W,  or excellent national steakhouses such as Shula's, like myself, you may not enjoy the steak cuts.  My New York Strip was fairly tough, and required some heavy cutting considering the $50 price.  If you can't cut a $50med. rare steak with a serrated butter knife, I don't want to eat it.  It probably has some good marbling as it was juicy and moist, but it had some tough fibers that were definitely not meat or bands of marbling.  This may be expected in a ribeye where tendonous material often lines the outer rim of the steak.\n",

      "Overall, a great dining experience with great service, but 3 stars because of meat cuts.\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Bam!  Emeril has done it again with his delicious steakhouse, Delmonico, located on the casino floor in restaurant row at the Venetian in Las Vegas.  We celebrated my sister's birthmonth and she received a complimentary note and ice cream dessert.  We started the night with a buttered crostini with salami on top, compliments of the chef.  We ordered the grilled octopus and bbq shrimps as appetizers, both were very tasty and prepared our tastebuds for the scintilating steak.  For sides, we had the buttered asparagus, mushrooms with multiple types, and duckfat fingerling potatos.  I had a bone-in rib eye that was well done with herb butter adorning the top which slowly seeped through the tender cut and infused the meat juices to provide for an even more flavorful bite.  For dessert we had Emeril's banana cream pie and the caramel butter cake, both so decadent and sweet, what a way to end a meal:)  The servers were very attentive and efficient.  The restroom, though it was a long hallway away and only had 2 stalls, was clean and well kept.  The ambience was classy and loud in some areas due to the archways and cavernous ceilings reminiscent of a wine cellar.  The dinner was very satisfying and the whole experience was an example of Emeril's excellence.  Thank you Delmonico Steakhouse for becoming one of my favorite strips of steak on the Las Vegas Strip!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I'm a simple dude.  I'm a thrifty dude.  When you combine the two, it's a wonder when I spend $40 on an entire night out.  So it was a significant deal for me to set foot into a place where a plate of food is on par with my average bar tab.  It was a special occasion so I shelved my cheap-skate side for the evening.\n",

      "My wife and I arrived early and had a drink at the bar.  The bartenders were exactly what I look for in one: chill, conversational, intelligent but not lording their smarts over you, and just nice dudes.  Our drinks were great (though I did have to swat at one fruit fly, but that happens).\n",

      "Dinner was unlike anything I'd ever had before.  Here's why:\n",
      "- Three servers throughout the course of our evening, and all of them were great\n",
      "- I was able to get a black napkin without asking\n",
      "- The table was perfectly sized; I didn't feel like I was going to nail someone with an elbow when they were sitting next to me\n",
      "- My wife ordered a Cesar salad which we split.  The thing was hand-prepared at our table and it was amazing\n",
      "- I ordered duck.  I'd never had duck before and felt this was a perfect opportunity to do so.  I expected a breast or perhaps a thigh--not a half of a duck.  From bite one to cleaning the bones, it was spectacular\n",
      "-Everyone at the table completely cleaned their plates (or had the intention of doing so if we didn't run out of time before our show--not for the sake of service, rather solid conversation).  Not one dissatisfied customer\n",
      "\n",
      "Should I come into a small fortune in the future, I'll certainly come back.  Until then, I'll just have to dream.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My girlfriend and i have been to Delmonico numerous times.  Everytime has been great.  We always get the Filet Mignon.  The cut is always perfect.  The side dishes are in very large portions.  I love the mushroom with my steak.  What makes Delmonico great isn't just the food.  The service is second to none.  We really do appreciate the great service at Delmonico.  We also appreciate the fact that every entree is delivered at the same time to every person.  We usually have 2 waiters and 2 bus boys serving us.  We go to Vegas sometimes just to go to Delmonico.  We typically pay about $160 for 2 people including tip.   We'll be back here everytime we're in town.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Great service.  Perfect bone-in ribeye steak.  Just so nice.  Service is consistently good over the years.  This is Las Vegas' best if not the world.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Before you digest any of my review it is important to say that I travel to Vegas on business and I find that with very few exceptions the restaurants, even the nice ones, to be poor imitations of what one would find in a city that hasn't been painted into existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, the steak I had at Delmonico was excellent and the service refreshing by Vegas standards.  The table-side Caesar salad preparation makes for good show and equally excellent taste.  It's not the quietest or the most interesting interior design, very basic and elegant if perhaps a bit crowded.  If you want a nicely cooked piece of quality meat only slightly on the spendy side this is a recommended option.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The food was amazing, the atmosphere was calming, and the service was great. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a fine dining experience in the area.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Definitely a fan of this place. Reminds me of a cross between my local favorites Ruth Chris in Irvine, Ca & Mortons in Santa Ana, Ca. Great service of course, awesome wine selection. Came her for my 40th & knew I was going to have steak so I went with their bone in ribeye & it was definitely not a mistake, no steak sauce necessary & never should need it at a good steak house. I'm never partial to chicken at more expensive places (I just don't see the point, may as well go all out & get the beef) but my wife had their roasted chicken & I had a taste of it & it was the most flavorful chicken dish I've ever had. I may just have to go against my favorites & get that the next time. All in all this place should be a 5 star but I've only been there once, I may adjust once I go back again in the new year.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This is by far the best meal I have eaten so far! We sat in a private room in the back and was able to tour the kitchen after our meal. The service was superb ! The food had so much flavor and everything was cooked to perfection . When you sit in the back the chef picks what you eat and that is the way to go.  I tried the foie gras, it tasted like a dessert and was so good. We started with halibut with risotto , lamb, ribeye and the best dessert ever. Pecan pie and banana foster pie.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] was there this past weekend with a group of 7 people... not a disappointed person in the party. the staff was super friendly and accomodating (we had children with us). i had mushroom crusted filet medallions. so good. we got sides of grits, corn and steamed broccoli... all three were great. we also ordered a few desserts, the banana cream pie was outrageous. so fresh and tasty. i didnt have the wine but my friends really enjoyed the bottle that was recommended to them.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] What better way to celebrate a big 3-0 than with a mean piece of steak! It was my good friend's birthday and we had two tables reserved for our big group. I must say, service was stellar. Staff was knowledgeable with their menu and very patient with us when placing our orders in as we were all quite indecisive and had so many questions.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Starting off with some bread and aperitif, I chose a glass of Blue label Chimay as my poison. Ahhhh...a wonderful prelude to an evening of indulgence. For appetizers, I had their OYSTER ROCKEFELLER. This baked aphrodisiac was not as cheesy as I hoped it would be but they were fresh and of good quality. I can't complain. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next came the main show, BONE-IN RIBEYE which my man and I split. Split plating was beautifully done with the perfect portion for each of us. No fee for split plate, thank you. I like my meat cooked medium and it came as pink as I expected it to be. A dollop of butter topped off my steak but that for me was unnecessary. It had quite a chew to it which was unlikely coming from Chef Emeril Lagasse's kitchen. Did it taste bad? No, not at all. I just think that being in Vegas where you are surrounded by a plethora of dining options of the same caliber, you need to live up to your name. Sadly, I wasn't as impressed by this dish compared to other fellow Yelpers. \n",
      "\n",
      "My side of choice was the CREAMED SPINACH. Now we're talking! It tasted sensational with that silky feel of butter and cream. Finally, Chef Emeril's true colors are coming out. And on a sweet note, we ended the evening with EMERIL'S BANANA CREAM PIE. Can I say, WOW!? I will have to say this was the best banana cream pie I've had to date. Hats off to you, Chef! This my friends, earned Delmonico Steakhouse the 4 stars I'm giving them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Would I come back? Sure! I'll skip the steak and try his southern specialties instead. But more importantly, I shall not forget EMERIL'S BANANA CREAM PIE. It's to die for!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Wow, we had the bone in ribeye, Caesar salad. It was fantastic. Service was impeccable. Restaurant was a little noisy on Saturday night but considering how good the steak was, I didn't care. I would definitely eat here again and again.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Best filet of my life! I'll be back. Grits were a bit undercooked, but the steak and mushrooms made up for the oversight. Amazingly attentive and friendly waiters.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Came here with friends for our high end streak meal during a recent week in Vegas. It did not disappoint. For drinks, I ordered a High West rye Manhattan and it arrived perfectly mixed; maybe the smoothest Manhattan I've ever imbibed. Ceaser salad very good, but no anchovies. Two of us split chateaubriand and it was perfect, although presentation was somewhat boring. The potatos and asparagus were good but not spectacular. Another friend got the fillet and it was so tender she started cutting it with get butter knife and didn't even notice! The wine list is overwhelming. 93 pages. It's better to know what you want and see  if it's there than to try and choose. The decor is somewhat vanilla, but nice.  Also, the place is huge - much larger inside than what you see when you walk in off Restaurant Row in The Palazzo.  The crowd made for pretty fun people watching; there seemd to be a lot of middle aged men with their much younger \"dates.\"  Maybe it was \"take your niece to dinner\" night.  But overall, a very nice, entertaining  evening out, but spendy.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] 4.5 out of 5 Stars.  Being an Emeril Lagasse restaurant, you had to expect the best.  \n",
      "\n",
      "One of my previous reviews of an expensive steakhouse stated that I could not imagine paying outrageous prices for a steak considering there are only so many ways that you can prepare it.  With that being said I still believe that is true, however I did not pay for my dinner this night since it was for Business :).  \n",

      "Delmonico's is located in The Venetian Resort and Casino right across from the Mirage.  I have always thought the Venetian was one of the more classy places to go in Vegas and Delmonico's was no different.  We called ahead to put our names in for an 8:00pm reso but we got there early at 7.  Some of us were dressed in shorts and flip flops, but since it was Vegas I think thats why we got away with it.  After checking in they said they could seat us early and to take a seat at the bar to relax.  After ordering a few drinks, we were seated promptly by a very friendly hostess.  (On a side note, they have an extensive Scotch list which includes some very rare 100 yr old Scotch's for $150-200 a pop).  We sat down towards the kitchen and was greeted by a stunning blonde waitress...I believe her name was Dale, but I could be mistaken.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We took a look at the menu and this place is not cheap.  You are looking at around 50 bucks for a steak.  Most of us ordered the Ribeye which is my favorite cut of meat and you can either get it bone-in or not bone-in...22oz or 16oz respectively. We started off with BBQ shrimp which is what they are known for and Ahi Tuna and Salmon Tartare.  Both of these were fantastic.  Our steaks came out quickly and they were cooked perfectly.  The sides here are a la carte and each could easily feed at least 4 people.  We got the garlic mashed potatoes and it too was quite delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all this place was amazing....They have a team of people, 3 to a table, to make sure your water is always filled, bread is on your plate, and that you have everything you would need.  \n",

      "The standouts were the spinach salad the poached egg made is awesome and the tartare superb.  For the sides highly recommend the twice baked potato, so cheesy, yum! The crust on the pecan pie was so flaky and light and delicious, I would order it every time! \n",

      "My heart does belong to the NYC Strip House, but I would go back to here if I were in Vegas again.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This place is about as bland as vanilla ice cream.... there is no style to the dining room, the service is slow and quiet, the steaks well... I have had much better... the only good is the deserts are very good, and the palce has a great wine list (albeit very pricey)... Vegas can do better (and it does)\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Nestled back in the row of restaurants in the Venetian Hotel and Casino, Delmonico Steakhouse owned and operated by Chef Emeril Lagasse.  Offering up Orleans-style eats in a comfortable setting.  High back armless leather chairs and white linen set tables are scattered amongst white walls with pillars and great sloping arches.  A uniquely curved ceiling provided an interesting twist on the events of the night, as I was able to clearly listen in on several conversations from other tables as if they were seated next to me.  I only wonder if they were listening in on us?\n",
      "\n",
      "On the way to our table we passed by a wall of wine encased in glass.  It was impressive to say the least and perusing their wine list hinted to the fact that it wasn't the only wall of wine in the establishment.  After calling for a nice bottle of champagne we ordered off of the menu and enjoyed an amuse buche.  A sort of pre-appetizer, a bite or two of something tasty, like something you might get at a cocktail party.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wait staff was at our side at all times to make sure we had ample amounts of liquids and dinner breads.  We made a little joke how I was not able to finish my meal because the waitress kept calling for my bread dish to be refilled...\"Would you like some more bread sir?\"  If she had asked how I was feeling I would have responded \"Better!\"  I would had surely thrown in an extra hundred on the gratuity if she followed through with the Python joke or offered a thin wafer mint.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could go through all the parts of the meal but we know from previous reviews that the food is above board in the field of taste.  My only comment in regard to anything on the menu would be to the quality of the beef.  I am by no means a steak snob but I know quality beef when I taste it.  Having tasted beef from different locations around the world from Kansas to Kobe, Delmonico Steakhouse has much room to improve their quality of steak.  No matter how well seasoned or prepared the order was, if you start out with average prime beef you will be eating average prime beef and for that they lose one star.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you do happen to stop by and eat at Delmonico, I suggest the sorbet desert, the multitude of tasty wines and the special... whatever it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be prepared for the price, because this place is proud of their food.  Four guests, champagne dinner with desert was well over $100 per person.  Will we be back?  But of course!  Las Vegas is the place for over indulgences.  What happens in Vegas... along with your money, stays in Vegas so enjoy it while you are there.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] One of the BEST steak houses in Vegas, no need to go anywhere else.\n",

      "The juices running down the plate, the char on the steak glowing in my face. \n",
      "\n",
      "For fans of rib eye, this is the place (get the bone in) I know you may not want to do the work, but its fantastic.  For the filet eaters like me, this is the place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tableside caesar was perfect.  The dressing was spot on, with anchovies (if requested) just the right amount of cheese, and other ingredients.  Its a do it.\n",

      "I stayed away from the potatoes, but had the creamed corn and spinach and good grief, the night kept getting better and better.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gran finale, was the biggest piece of banana cream pie I have ever had.\n",
      "This is no ordinary banana cream pie.  This is over 5 layers of pure banana pieces baked with the best crust and cream you have ever had in your life.\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We went to Delmonico's in the Palazzo/Venetian for a pre-theater dinner.  While nothing was bad, it wasn't a four or five star experience, either.  The service was competent, and the restaurant decor is definitely upscale.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This is an Emeril restaurant, so they have some cajun/creole items on the menu along with steak and seafood.  I started with the Ahi and Salmon Tartare.  A nice starter served with a small cucumber salad, but nothing extraordinary.  The lobster bisque arrived after sitting on the pass for awhile, it seemed, as there was already a skin atop the soup.  It was a nice bisque, about what you'd expect at a steakhouse.  The petite iceberg wedge salad was, again, pretty standard with bacon and blue cheese.  I finished with the Halibut served over what they call vegetable risotto.  It was good; maybe a bit overcooked, but I enjoyed it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the table ordered appetizers and steaks, and while they said the steaks were good...no fireworks to speak of.  I did try a bit of my GF's ribeye, and was actually a bit surprised that it was lacking flavor in my opinion.  The ribeye is usually very flavorful, but this almost tasted like a filet; tender, but without any real steak pop and just a hint of gaminess.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, especially for the price, I thought the food would have been a bit more inspired, but as it ended up it was just OK.  Not a place I'd steer anyone away from, since the menu is diverse and the wine list very respectable, but if you're looking for something really special, I don't think this really hits the mark.  There are certainly better steak and seafood restaurants in Vegas that are less, at, or a bit more than this price point that would be much better.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly enough, despite the restaurant's name...they had no Delmonico steak on the menu.  I thought that was a bit odd, as well.  :)\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] What an experience!\n",

      "Three servers were helping us, and they were very attentive throughout the night. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our meal started off with complimentary bread. It kind of reminded me of yorkshire pudding. It was really light and airy. I liked it because it didn't make me as full. \n",
      "\n",
      "Both of us ordered the bone-in rib eye cooked medium rare. It was cooked nicely, and it had nice flavors. I didn't realize it while I was eating, but the steak was really salty. I couldn't stop drinking water all night. We also ordered the wild mushroom side dish. This can definitely use less salt. To end our meal, our server gave us a birthday dessert- blueberry sorbet. Because we were so full, we ordered the banana cream pie togo. It was boxed nicely and I was able to enjoy this dessert later that night. It was delicious, but if you don't like bananas, don't get it. \n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I have been fortunate enough to dine at many upscale steakhouses across the country. This is by the best I have ever been to! The service, food and experience are incredible! When I visit Las Vegas, this restaurant is a priority during my trip. If you have not been, it is a must! You will not be disappointed. Best steak ever!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My quest for trying all the highly rated steakhouses in Vegas brought me to Delmonico. And I wasn't disappointed. \n",

      "\n",
      "Unlike alot of other steakhouse where you feel cramped, and surrounded by ear deafening drunks, at Delmonico the ceiling is high, tables are placed with room to run around (not recommended).

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I have had the best meal of MY LIFE, on 3 separate occasions at Emeril Lagasse's Delmonicos.  I loved how I have never been let down when I have gone there.  I really enjoy steak, and his bone-in ribeye was the best I have EVER had - the crust on the medium-rare perfection was amazing.  \n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, I expect a great steak at any steakhouse I go to, so that's not enough to make this my best meal ever.  However, the sides and dessert we equally amazing! The creamed spinach is unlike any other I've ever had, the mushroom were succulent, and the football sized baked potato really hit the spot.  The service was great, the ambiance is perfect, and the chairs and tables are very comfortable.\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Honestly, I wanted to like this place. This was not our first time there but it will be our last. The Cesar salad was the highlight of the meal and still one of the best I've ever had. The steak was just OK. The sides were quite good but it is a steakhouse so I was expecting something much better. The deserts were not bad just not mind blowing. For the price, unfortunately it was not worth it.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The only thing that would make dining at Delmonico's any better would be if Emeril Lagasse himself were sitting at your table.  On second thought, it might get awkward it he started yelling \"BAM\" every time I took a bite of food.\n",
      "\n",
      "Delmonico's has always been one of my favorite spots in Vegas.  I eat here anytime I'm in the city.  The service is always top notch and the food has consistently been delicious.  You really can't go too wrong with their menu.  The waitstaff assigned to your table are very helpful when you ask about the various dishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I typically go with steak when I eat here.  They have always been cooked to perfection.  On my last visit, I had the grilled filet mignon medallions served with the mushroom crust, bacon and cheese.  I'm also a fan of the filet mignon served oscar style as well.  Both excellent.  Sides are great too.  Twice baked potato, mmmmmmmmm!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Steak was very good, sides were ok, and our waiter was helpful but didn't look to be overly excited about working.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Amazing!! The food was delicious!  I ordered the lobster soup as an entrée and the Salmon on a bed of potatoes it was amazing! My husband had Steak and potatoes it was cooked to perfection. It is pricey but worth every penny. We will definitely be back for our anniversary.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Finally made me give up on Emeril's restaurants.  We were some of the first customers at Emeril's at Universal Studios here in Orlando, which was OUTSTANDING when it first opened and the first few visits after that.  Then it started going downhill - poor service and bad food.  It was so bad, we swore we wouldn't frequent any of Emeril's restaurants ever again.  Then we were in Vegas and at the Palazzo looking for a place to eat.  We foolishly decided to give Delmonico a try.  Worst service we've had in a long time.  The waiter acted like we were bothering him.  He disappeared after dropping the menus and wine list on our table.  When he finally showed back up and I ordered a glass of wine (he didn't offer drinks when he dropped the menus on the table), I didn't get it for a good 10 minutes.  If I had been by myself, I would have walked out, but my wife didn't want to do that.  Dinner showed up and we started to eat.  My glass of wine ran out, with absolutely no sign of our waiter.  I finally had to flag down another waiter to ask for my wine.  Truly pathetic.  Food-wise, I don't know where the other reviewers have been having their steaks, but I have no clue why they would say these are the best steaks they've ever had.  It was OK, but certainly not worth the price we paid (and, trust me, I don't mind spending money in a restaurant).\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Went here with friends at 1030 p.m. following the marathon and amazed that they let my husband in while wearing his running attire as this is truly fine dining and he looked extraordinarily out of place.  After losing an undisclosed amount of money, I wasn't really in the mood to eat yet another expensive meal; however...\n",
      "\n",
      "I was prepared for high prices and adequate food but my oh my was I in for a pleasant surprise... at least on 50% of the expectations.  Food Fabulous and Prices were indeed expensive but I have to say worth the full experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband shared the Chateaubriand Carved Tableside for Two, Asparagus and Garlic Smashed Potatoes for  $110 - Same as the Filet however, it comes with sides and costs less.  It was prepared PERFECTLY and was delicious from the first bite to the last bite.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Other sides folks had and loved were: New Orleans Creamed Spinach;  Twice Baked Potato with Bacon and Vermont Cheddar\n",
      "The wine we chose (we asked for a med-full bodied red with a smooth finish and complex aromas that didn't cost more than $100 or $1000 (see photo of wine prices)  He actually suggested something for around $60 or so and it was exquisite!  \n",

      "Add this to your to do list in Vegas and go hungry!!  Don't be shy to ask for a wine within your price range... they don't carry any bad wines so why pay a thousand bucks for wine?  LOVED THIS RESTAURANT!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The entire experience was phenomenal!  From the staff, food presentation (loved the table side preparation of our Caesar salad), and of course the flavor of the food. We would absolutely return for another dinner.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My hubby and I had date night here before seeing Zumanity- This was one of the best steaks I have ever had. We are from Texas, so we know good steak. I got mine crusted with Blue Cheese. We had the garlic mushrooms and 2x baked potato. The atmosphere is great and the dessert was AMAZNG. We had the Banana cream pie. To die for!!! We booked online!!!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Had the occasion to eat here recently and although it was gook, it honestly didn't meet my expectations.  Of course everyone is going to have different expectations. Maybe because it's Emeril's but I was expecting just something much better.  \n",

      "The food was on par for a steak house of this caliber though a little on the high side, which is premium you pay for the Lagasse name.  I can't review anything that already hasn't been said.  I had the rib eye which was good, sides I can't even remember.  Bread as others have mentioned was not memorable.  I'll have to disagree with others about the banana cream pie..  just didn't seem to have the flavor I was expecting.. just a lot of not sweet enough whipped cream.\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] One of the best meals.  The steaks are aged and melt in your mouth.   Fast a day prior so you can enjoy an appetizer, salad, entree and dessert.  This place rocks!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I came here back in 2005 with my family and had a phenomenally memorable meal. Six years later -- I came back this past weekend and it was STELLAR. Extensive wine list, excellent service, ridiculously buttery brioche bread, great cocktails, and of course, the food!\n",
      "\n",
      "For apps, my party had the truffle chips (so rich but delish!), squash ravioli with duck confit (superb), lobster bisque (mmm with large lobster chunks), and the wedge salad (as perfect as a classic wedge gets). \n",
      "\n",
      "For entrees, I had the filet mignon that was PERFECTLY cooked to a true medium-rare. I often find that, when I order med-rare, more often than not, highly rated restaurants overcook my meat to more of a med to med-well, which is can be disappointing. Well, here at Delmonico, it was PERFECT! Friends got the bone-in ribeye and the huge $85 Fred Flinstone steak (I forget the official name), all cooked to perfection. The 2007 Joseph Phelps Cab paired divinely with the steaks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sides:  creamed corn was mind-blowing; creamed spinach was good but didn't knock my socks off (compared to everything else which did). \n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Emeril knows his steaks!  I went here 2 nights in a row (1) business dinner with clients (2) took my bf out for his bday.  Both times were excellent, did not disappoint.  Well, the business dinner was actually better since I didn't have to pay!  When in Vegas, you must indulge, so why not here - the service is top notch, the food is to die for.  Wonderfully cooked steaks, the sides are awesome.  Dessert was also great. \n",

      "Funny story - there was a group of about 6 older gentlemen at the table next to us.  We had already paid (I paid) and were just about to leave and they asked me to take their photo.

After I took their picture, one of the guys said I did a \"good thing\" back there when he saw me paying for us :)  He said I was \"a good woman.\" \n",

      "\n",
      "Disappointing... hardly marbled... flavorful yes, but tough enough where I couldn't enjoy every bite.  My pallet favors texture over flavor and although my wife felt the steaks were flavorful, in my opinion the toughness completely buries any goodness from the flavor.\n",

I do give Emeril or the chef who cooked my steak credit in which the steak had an awesome flavor in every bite i took but still the meal is nothing more than average! I would give Delmonico's a 3 1/2 star!\n",

      "\n",
      "The service is second to none. I don't know what the wait staff to guest ratio is, but it has to be 2-1. I also absolutely LOVE how they put every person's plate down at the exact same time, period. You're a party of ten? Then ten of Delmonico's finest serve you all at once. And man do they now their business. I've never had a recommendation be anything but excellent!\n",
      "\n",
      "The food.... Did I say wow???? My personal favorite is the bone-in rib eye, but all of the meat is fantastic. I order mine rare, so it is easy to get a tough steak, but not here!!! It is just lie butter.... Yum.... The BBQ shrimp are amazing, and homemade truffle potato chips??? Wow.... I could go on and on.... Creme Brule is amazing, as is the bread pudding.\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My new favorite steak house!! Ordered wine, got the bbq Shrimp as an appetizer then started with the Lobster Bisque then the real deal came my medium rare Bone in Rib eye then finished it off with creme brulee.  Bbq shrimp! just so yummy!!!! The Lobster Bisque was nice and creamy. The steak was the melt in your mouth type of steak. Great flavor and nothing close to being dry. The creme brulee was delicious!  I've tried a few steak houses and thought they were pretty good but after trying this place....  This is really \"woohoo! As good as it gets!\"  five stars.Thank you Emeril!!!!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Another one of Emeril's top notch restaurants, this one being a steak connoisseur's paradise.  We booked the night before and got in before the traditional 7-7:30 dinner rush.  Service- top notch.  Mind you, everything is a la carte.I cant help but feel underdressed even though we were dressed well for the venue.  They have an insane wine list that goes on and on.  I had the bone-in ribeye which was done to perfection - medium rare.  We also had the creamed spinach and wild mushrooms.  So good we finished everything leaving little to no room for dessert.  Definitely should try the dessert since they all looked exceptional, especially Emeril's claim to fame Banana Cream Pie!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Had a very nice birthday dinner here and really, really enjoyed it. The atmosphere is simple and classic, it occurred to me that they were striving to feature the food with such simple ambiance, and they succeeded. \n",
      "\n",
      "The service was fantastic, we had a team of servers for our party of 6 and we did not wait for a single thing throughout dinner. They did manage to find that balance between being attentive and hovering, it was perfect. Hubby and I had the table side prepared Cesar salad and it was excellent. For dinner I had the rare filet and I really enjoyed it, and the table shared the grits (my personal favorite of the entire dinner), spinach and mushrooms. For desert we had the peppermint profiteroles, which were so so (I'm not a big peppermint fan though). \n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The best choice for steaks in Las Vegas.  The staff are expert servers.  I have gone here for both intimate dinners and group dining, and all experiences have been beyond our expectations.  Start with the truffled parmesan chips, then the tomato salad, the mushrooms, the filet (black and blue of course), one of the potato specials, and stay for dessert (they sell cigars in the bar) and a glass of scotch to finish off the meal.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] i had the bbq salmon and it was wow perfect, yummmmm...the service was excellent also, side of their garlic mashed potatoes were fantastic also, definitely be going back\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Simply delicious. I had the pork chop and my coworkers dived into the steak. Everything was so tasty, cooked to perfection. Definitely one of the better steakhouses I've dined in. Will definitely be back for more\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] It is with a heavy heart, a disappointed palate, and an empty stomach that I write this review. At around 8:40pm on a Wednesday like any other, an amazing 20 ounce bone-in ribeye was murdered by the cooks at Delmonico Steakhouse in Las Vegas, Nevada. A senseless, tragic loss really. \n",

      "Drinks were delivered, as was a meh amuse bouche (didn't do much to invoke my appetite). While waiting on main course, we sat with empty drink glasses for approximately 15 minutes. \"Yes, please, another round\" after flagging someone down.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The highly anticipated steaks arrived. Had SO looked forward to dining (have been to Delmonico in N'Oleans and LOVED it) - salivating for the meat like Pavlov's dog.\n",
      "\n",
      "Husband cut into his steak first and I awed at the perfection. Beautifully cooked (I know my steak temps well and am quite skilled on the grill if I may say so; #humblebrag, but I do live in Texas after all). I could immediately tell when my plate was sat down in front of me my steak was overcooked. I even whispered it to my spouse. Sure enough, borderline well-done on the edges. I optimistically had hoped it would be less done toward the thicker center and toward the bone. Nope.   \n",
      "\n",
      "When a waiter came to follow-up and ask how the steak was, I informed him mine...well, was not good. He did offer to refire; however, given the speed that my husband eats, and the amount of time it took the food to be delivered in the first place, I [foolishly] declined and stated that it was \"fine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Management comped one of the two Tito's I ordered as an apology; however, this did little to suppress my internal sadness and the most amount of disappointment I'd had since losing my ars at the blackjack tables the night before. \n",
      "\n",
      "In all fairness, the staff at D's did try their best to accommodate. I probably should have allowed them a second chance to present a well-prepared piece of beef. It wasn't until I got home and found the $164 (w/out tip) receipt from the night in my wallet that I began to feel what can only be described as selfish-remorse (aka, sometimes referred to as \"buyer's remorse\").\n",
      "\n",
      "So after a few days of ruminating (as females are sometimes known to do), I called the restaurant and told them I regretted my decisions and to thank them for at least attempting to \"satisfy the customer.\" Without any provocation, the manager offered to send me a gift card for $50 to cover a steak during my next visit. I, of course, did not expect the offer, but happily provided my mailing address. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have found that an unfortunate outcome of many \"celebrity\" chef restaurants opening in LV is that the quality of both service and food suffer. It's the nature of Sin City and the abundance of tourism - people from all over the world with very different palates - some more or less discerning than others. :'(  \n",
      "\n",
      "So, now I have a GC that I can redeem at any of Emeril's establishments. I doubt I'll be using it at Delmonico in Vegas baby, because frankly I've left the building and think I'll stick to D's in the Big Easy. Sin City killed the beefy magic for me. Cheers!\n",

      "I took my husband to Delmonico for his birthday last night and we were both VERY disappointed with the food. His filet looked so dry and shriveled, I was surprised they served it. There was no \"essence\" only a lot of salt. He chocked it down because he didn't want to disappoint me. I had the chicken breast with fingerling potatoes and onion sauce. Someone must have shaked a cup of salt over everything. I couldn't tell what I was eating and after a few bites said  I wanted to save room for dessert.\n",
      "In all fairness, the service was excellent and the decor classy and not over done. The only thing we enjoyed was the chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream.\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Great service! The staff was professional, attentive, and friendly.  The popovers were very light and delicious. We ordered the wedge salad and lobster bisque as our appetizers. Both were delicious and we were really impressed with the bisque.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered the bone in rib eye and lobster stuffed with crab. There was nothing impressive about these two dishes. My husband liked to lobster but said the crab mixture had too much mayo (?). My ribeye cut was too fatty and didn't need the butter. I felt like I was eating a rib eye from Paula Dean's kitchen. \n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We love Delmonico and eat here every time in Vegas. However, our meal was disappointing. The highlight of the meal was our appetizer & desert. We started with the truffle chips, which was a good portion. We both then ordered steaks, NY strip and bone in ribeye and shared the twice baked potato. My steak was over cooked, as I requested medium rare and it was over cooked.  We finished our meal with the pecan pie for desert. We will be probably be back, just hope for better next time.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We had the worst service there. The bread never came until we asked and when we got it, it was cold. The only way the bread can be cold on  a very busy night was the left over from other tables. \n",
      "The food was good except the Thanksgiving turkey meal was bad! Tasteless, not good at all!!\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Ordered the seafood tower at $130 came with oysters on the half shell, 2 lobster tails split in half which were slightly overlooked and rubbery. A handful of shrimp which tasted farm raised and lacked a good wild shrimp taste. Tuna tartare was great and the crab legs were great.\n",

      "Warm wilted spinach salad ($15) came out with a deep fried soft boiled egg and bacon with candy pecans baked on it. There was spinach in there but a 2000 calorie salad isn't really that much of a salad. Still it was good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Added to that the bone in 45 day aged ribeye ($50). That was magnificent. Huge, flavorful and all around award winning.  Had the creamed spinach ($10), creamed corn ($10) and steak fries ($10). The creamed corn want good. It was just bland. The rest were good.\n",

      "Service is exceptional. Had a few Tito vodka Martina's with blue cheese olives as well Jacob were expertly made. For 5 of us the total bill was close to $1000. Be prepared to spend $$$.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Really good service and food.  I loved the mozzarella bruschetta we had, it had amazingly good flavor (garlic, shallots, tomatoes) drizzled lightly with either a balsamic reduction or really well aged balsamic vinegar, and on a toast point that wasn't hard and crusty.  Their soup special was pumpkin soup, creamy and seasoned nicely.  My husband I both got salads, I got the spinach salad with bacon and he got the fresh baby greens.  Both were good.  Too bad we came to a steakhouse and only ordered vegetarian dishes, we were just overwhelmed by all the heavy food we've been eating since we arrived in Vegas.  Next time, we'll try their seafood or meat dishes.  We finished off our meal with dessert, the fruit cobbler topped with caramel ice cream was YUM!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I had such a delicious dinner at this restaurant!!

      "\n",
      "I got the barbecue shrimp which was phenomenal. The shrimp was done to perfection and the sauce was delicious. The biscuit was a little bit hard but not as important as everything else.  They also served popovers on the table instead of bread. The popovers were chewy and gummy and I would've preferred some other type of bread on the table. Maybe they're not fantastic at making bread. \n",
      "\n",
      "I got the special of a bone in filet mignon cooked rare. The rare was done perfectly! I was very impressed.  I also got the grits and the creamed corn for side dishes. Their grits were a little bit grainy for my taste although the flavor was good. The creamed corn was fabulous!\n",
      "\n",
      "Our table pretty much ordered one of every dessert. I ordered the banana cream pie based on a friend's recommendation. I have to say that was not my favorite but that's because I don't care for bananas in my dessert. My bad since I knew that. The banana cream pie was extremely dense with bananas. However I traded with another friend who got the pecan pie in the oatmeal cookie crust. Oh my gosh that was heaven!!  \n",

      "The dinner was superb and the service was excellent! I would return here again in the future and I would recommend it to anyone visiting Vegas.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Thinking of what to say, I find it's hard to stay on track and remember that I'm reviewing a meat 'n potatoes steakhouse that doesn't go out of it's way to be too fancy or adventurous, it just strives to make good food in a nice environment. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think a little is lost if you forget Chef Emeril's philosophy; watch him on TV, the guy just likes good food.  Remember Erik, you didn't eat at Bouchon or French Laundry... you didn't go on a magical food adventure.  You had a steak.  A damned good steak.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ambiance is nice; dimly-lit, full-service, white-linen business casual kind of place.  The wife and I had good, attentive service, and our head waiter was a treat.  He was incredibly accommodating and helpful.  I had fun listening to him give the table next to us tips on eating in Vegas, steering that couple away from Tao (\"A nightclub that happens to serve food.\") and Cut (\"Way too salty and LA pretentious for my taste.  Maybe they've toned it down... the salt, anyway.\")\n",
      "\n",
      "We started out with two appetizers, as we usually do, our favorite Emeril's New Orleans BBQ shrimp with petite rosemary biscuit, and to get into the steakhouse mood, the wonderful truffle and parmesan potato chips.\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife had the filet mignon medallions crusted in mushrooms with a pan sauce, don't remember of what, and I had the 9 oz. filet mignon with a small pad of maitre'd butter, cooked to a warm, pink, bloody center.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both were EXCELLENT.  For dessert, we capped our meal, and ourselves off with Emeril's banana cream pie and the pecan pie.  I had a single jamaican blue mountain courtesy of cafes richard.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The food was excellent, service was spot-on, and atmosphere was great, if a tad noisy.  Unfortunately, the authentic Kobe filet I had at Fish House spoiled me on steaks forever, so as good as Delmonico is, I can only muster 4 stars.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Fantastic food, great service.  Much more expensive than what we usually spend on dinner, but so yummy and worth it!  We both had steak for dinner, with sides of salad in the sherry ving., garlic smashed potatoes, and the pecan pie.  I wish we had room to finish the pecan pie, but could only get through half.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Before I went to this place, I checked some reviews which were mostly positive. First, staff was very courteous and decor was simple and inviting. One thing I noticed was there were way too many employees waking and standing around and it was very distracting at times. As for the food, other than the Bone in Ribeye steak which was decent considering the portion and the price, everything else was a real disappointment. I got better lobster bisque at Lobster ME next door for $4, I mean A Lot BETTER. Their soup was awful.\n",
      "I really wanted to like this place considering it was our wedding anniversary but it was a real letdown.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Went in last night with a party of 5.  Unfortunately the service was really off.  Having dined here a few times with solid results, I was underwhelmed by this meal.  Took about 20 minutes to get the drinks out, was served appetizers with no silverware, soup was barely warm 1st time, 2nd try hot with a skin, mains sat for 15 min on a tray waiting to be served.  Spoke with the manager and he end up taking one of the mains off the bill.  Way to much competition in steakhouses at this price point to risk a repeat of this experience.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Outside of the steak I ordered being slightly raw by the bone, which the manager notice and resolved. This place was perfection. I normally do not give any place 5 stars but after being here two nights in a row with constant experiences, I am confident in my review. \n",
      "\n",
      "Only complaint. The ceiling in the main dining room has arched contours, which causes you to be able to hear clear as day the conversation of a table 20 feet away when sitting in the right position. Which apparently I was. I could even hear the sidebar whispers.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I was over here for dinner the other night.  It took a while to get seated on a busy Saturday night, so we hung out at the lounge for a bit.  Once we were seated though, the service was pretty good, as well as the setting.  It was too loud as far as ambiance goes, but it wasn't too invasive.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We grabbed the Stuffed Pork Trotter, which by itself could be an entree as opposed to the appetizer.  After we were \"stuffed\" with the pork trotter, we proceeded on to the main course.  I grabbed the boneless rib-eye, which was very intimidating.  I also shared some sides of spinach and mashed potatoes.  All of the main entree items were excellent, though I was too full to finish the rib-eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place is probably one of the better steakhouses I've been to in a long while, despite the prices, which I was fine with paying.  Bring an empty stomach, but a full wallet.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We were sat at 9:15. Dinner arrived at 10:45...  Those of us not drinking wine were not offered anything other than water. Once dinner arrived a couple of the steaks were placed in front of the wrong patrons. Instead of just correcting the issues, the server/manager restated what I ordered (the bone in NY strip). The steak in front of me was very clearly a filet. Our wine glasses were not cleared until our dinner plates were...\n",
      "The steaks were decent. Not amazing, but adequate...  \n",
      "Restroom was dirty, toilet seat damaged, no hand towels. \n",
      "A relatively pitiful attempt at a fine dining experience.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] WOW! Incredible all around! They had such great, great food. The service was exceptional everyone must get served at the same time, and when you get a salad (we got caesar) they make it table side. I can't think of one thing to complain about. I had a perfect experience here!\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The bone in rib eye was delicous and the cream of spinach and the grits and bacon sides were flavorful.  This is a huge slab of meat and I had a hard time finishing all 18 ounces of it.  The only reason why I didn't give this place a 5 was because of house expensive it is.  I'm all about quality at an affordable price and I would only go again to this place for like a 10 year anniversary.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This place won't blow up the sky with \"it's the best ever\" fireworks but it is more than just a sparkler during the fourth of July.  \n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] For me to give this place 3 stars takes complete honesty from me and also shows my disappointment.  I wanted so much to love this place, to crown it, (it wasn't what I thought it was!), to walk out wholly satisfied in the knowledge that I will not have a better steak.  Dining here was supposed to be one of the cornerstones of this Vegas trip, \"remember the time we ate at Delmonico's...\" type thing.  The 3 stars is my confession to myself, this place was not worth the price.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm no lover of Cajun food, or spices or anything, and the only thing I know about Emeril is he says \"BAM!\" a lot and the character Elzar on Futurama is a direct parody of him.  I've got no urge to try any more of his food though.  We ate here the evening of the Final Four, had an early reservation and was seated promptly in a fairly quiet room.  Good corner location where we could look out at everything around us but not have people walk by us.  The decor was not of any note... \n",
      "\n",
      "We started with the cocktail shrimp with crackers... very odd.  I've been eating a lot of shrimp lately, and there was nothing special about these.  The sauce was a bit spicier than others, so decent.  I pushed my girlfriend to try the kobe...  while I stuck with my old standby of NY.  The bread was nothing special as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sides were pretty average... I enjoyed my girlfriend's fried scallops though.  The vegetables and potatoes are just complements to the meal though.  The kobe steak came all sliced up and ready to go... It wasn't the mind blowing experience with kobe that I hoped it would be.  I could see the disappointment on my gf's face as she chewed on it.  On the plus side, the kobe sirloin meal came with the sides so thats a few bucks saved.  And sadly, thats the plus side of it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "My steak was of a fairly average size, maybe an inch thick, bone-in and perhaps 16 ounces.  I ordered it medium... which the waiter confirmed would be pink throughout.  I waver between medium-rare and medium.. usually if a steak is bone-in I go medium.  Unfortunately, my steak was overcooked.  It got to that bastard style known as medium-well.  I kept hoping as I got closer to the bone it would pinken up, but no such luck.  I ate it happily as it was still a good steak, but I just couldn't shake the disappointment.  The seasoning used on it was decent and had some spice to it but no charm to it.  Part way through my meal I attempted to knife-lift a portion for the gf to try, and wound up dropping it on the table cloth leaving a huge outline of meat.  We laughed about it and both expected our waiter to say something, anything about it as he brushed it with the crumb brush.  Sigh, no such warmth here.  Service was efficient and not quite friendly.  I guess high end steakhouses cater to clients that would rather not have their imperfections pointed out.  One look at me would suggest I'm not the typical client, but no joke came from either our waiter or the assistant waiter.  \n",
      "\n",
      "After we perused the desert menu, I settled on the banana cream pie.  This was the best banana cream pie I've ever had.  It was beautifully presented, had fresh bananas, and was not too sweet.  This was the favorite part of the meal for me.  I doubt I'll ever have a better banana cream pite,  but I'll keep looking.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, a decent meal but not worth the price.  Meal was ~$200 for 2, no drinks, nothing particularly noteworthy.  I doubt I'll ever go back on my own wallet.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The steak melts in your mouth. This restaurant is superb. The food is wonderful. The service is fantastic. You should make a reservation.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My wife and I ate at Delmonico the night of July 4th. I had the bone-in ribeye and my wife had the filet. My wife's filet was tasty and what one would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. Unfortunately, my ribeye was tough and full of fat. I would say about half of it was edible. With al of the choices to enjoy a quality steak in Vegas, ignore the hype and go somewhere else.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I was so impressed with the sister restaurant in New Orleans that I opted to make a reservation here for hubby's bday.  We arrived an hour early for our reservation and they were able to seat us.  They sent over a complimentary amuse bouche of steak sate that wowed us while we enjoyed an outstanding Pomegranite Martini and Key Lime Martini.  For people who love wine, the menu is extensive and expensive.  Overall, the food was good (don't order the creamed spinach, it tastes like Birds' Eye frozen), and the service was excellent (thanks, George!).  Pricey, but knew that heading in, and the cuts of meat and preparation met were worth the $$$$ price.  The special salad that evening (mixed baby greens with lavendar and baby brie turnovers and candied pecans was much better than my proscioutto (chewy slab, not shaved) and mozzarella.  A nice place for a special dinner.  Overall I have to say I enjoyed the food at the NOLA location but liked the sophisticated atmosphere and vibe of this Venetian restaurant better.  Glad we went but next time I'm in Vegas not sure I wouldn't head back without trying another similar restaurant first.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Simply put; The finest Steakhouse in the country.  The food is always mind-blowing and the service is exceptional.  Bring your wallet cause you pay for the BEST.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] After our poor dining experience at Valentino, we decided to try Emeril's restaurant, the Delmonico.  What a night and day difference.  While we'd had to put up with snobby staff at Valentino, the wait staff at Delmonico was informed, helpful, friendly, and a lot of fun to interact with.  And THE FOOD !!!  Oh my word, our ribeye steak was so fabulous we couldn't wait to try it again and went back the very next day for more of the same.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] \"Everything taste good except for the steak and foie gas~ seriously, not even outback quality. Lobster bisque and pecan pie saved the day.. Don't come if u want decent steak. Like Gordon's steakhouse, this place is overrated~~~\" I am giving 3 starts just because of the amazing lobster bisque  and the surprisingly good pecan pie. Also, the service is too good to deserve a two star. Me and my friend paid 80d/person to eat here and we didn't get the expected experience. I know we all expected vegas to be overpriced but I would rather pay for some other restaurant that would worth it.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This restaurant was top notch. The food was tremendous and so was the service. The atmosphere was sophisticated and simple at the same time. I highly recommend this restaurant for a formal dinner.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Delmonico has become our default steakhouse in Las Vegas. We've never had less than exemplary service and amazing food here, for either lunch or dinner. The staff is on-point, with notes made as to our personal preferences as to table location, etc. The waitstaff is friendly, knowledgeable, efficient and reliable. The food is superb. Quality ingredients prepared in quality ways. I definitely recommend the steak tartare as an appetizer. The only \"heads-up\" I'd give new patrons is that the sides are rather large. Ordering three or four sides with dinner is contra-indicated unless you are with a large group or dining with teenagers.\n",

      "Excellent bar and bartenders as well. Ask for the whisky menu and just revel in the selection.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] So when you go to a restaurant like this please expect a bit of a drawn out dinner, I think it was two and a half hours for our large party. Many said it was the best food they had in their life, and it was really wonderful. I will say that the appetizers had far more imagination than the main course which was a bit deflating. \n",
      "\n",
      "We went after a long day at a convection and most of us were tired and slightly delirious so the service being a tad slow made the dinner feel very much like The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover. They do the thing where they set all the plates at once and the glasses never went empty and the wine list is to die for, they had a 15000 dessert wine that dated before the Titanic. \n",
      "\n",
      "One star is really for the main course not living up the expectations set previously.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This probably tops my list of favorite restaurants.  I've been coming here since it first opened and it never disappoints.  The service here is impeccable, the steaks are amazingly delicious and the restaurant itself is very classy and decorated nicely.  I recommend the bone-in rib eye and filet mignon.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] One of the best meals of my life.  My friends and I were celebrating in Vegas, and looking for a place to do it up.  A $50 bottle of French wine later and the meal we had was filling, hedonistic, awesome, whatever superlative I could give.\n",
      "\n",
      "The appetizers were great; I had gumbo, and split barbeque shrimp and butternut squash ravioli with duck confit on top.  Portions for apps were not  teeny, which was impressive, because honestly I expected it to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then comes the main course.  All four of us split the chateaubriand, which was tender, carved tableside, and delicious.  The crust of the steak was delicious as well.  Almost as impressive were the side dishes; truffle parmesan potato chips and creamed corn (Yes, who thought Creamed Corn could emerge from the cafeteria lunch as a DELICIOUS side dish).\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, it's expensive; it's Vegas.  But I was very impressed with the quality.  Will gladly go back when I have more $.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Very good food! You have to try the banana cream pie. It is awesome! I had the bone in rib eye and it was delicious even though it was pretty fatty. The price is very high so come prepared to spend some $$$.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Not worth the money. It was not that great, food was just plain. I had Rib Steak and New York. It wasn't cooked the way a wanted. I had to send it back. They recooked the same piece. And it came up dry with a big slab of unmelted butter on top to cover up. Almost made me sick. Not worth the money not even close\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The past few visits to the Venetian Hotel I've made it a point to eat at Demonico's. The service is impeccable, waiters remove plates the second you are finished and they are very approachable. The most recent trip I had the braised pork appetizer w/cranberry, creole mustard and basil which was delicious. The entree consisted of the charbroiled bone-in filet mignon with roasted root vegetables, fingerling potatoes and jumbo onion rings. Very fun. Thanks to Hector, my server, everything arrived on time and well prepared.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Came here on vacation after a four hour drive from Los Angeles. We didn't change out of our road trip clothes but there was no judgement. The servers were always around and very friendly. The bread was amazing, never had one exactly like it before. We started with the truffle chips which were amazing! The chips aren't 100% evenly cooked/flavored but they were totally worth taking the leftovers to our hotel room. They didn't get all soggy the next day. For my meal we had the lobster sliders. When I took a bite it was something I didn't except at all but it was still delicious. LOTS of lobster meat as well. The bread is warm but the meat is cool and it blends well together instead of clashing. We were too full after that but would love to come back and try some more items.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I'm hardly ever in Vegas, and when I am here it's #rage before #forage (hah, hah), so I must admit that I've only tried a handful of Vegas' steakhouses. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, what I can tell you is that Delmonico's BONE IN RIBEYE ($55) is absolutely divine. One of the best ribeyes I've ever had, LA and Vegas combined.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Husband suggested that we come back here for lunch today. They started us off with two bread poppers each which were not bad. I ordered a lobster bisque soup as starter which was insanely delicious. Probably one of the better lobster bisques I've ever tasted.  It has big chunks of lobster meat in the soup.  Although the first sip of the soup seemed a little salty, the flavor is very good, strong and savory. It is one of my favorite dishes here. \n",
      "\n",
      "My husband ordered the beef carpaccio arugula salad because the salad we normally order from here is no longer on the menu. We were not sure what to order but after we tasted the salad we loved it. It is a very large salad which almost felt like a meal and it has a very clean balanced savory taste.  My husband says that this was one of his favorite salads; me on the other hand I still like the old salad I used to older here.  maybe I'm just more old-school and like my salad plain with arugula, spinach, tomatoes and good cheese. \n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered two entrées. One was the salmon entrée which was insanely divine. It is served with a big piece of salmon fillet with grilled sweet corn and crab pieces which complimented the salmon impeccably. Both my husband and I love this dish and we both indicated that we will be ordering this again in the future when we come back here. In fact we may each order one of this salmon dish. That is how much we love this dish. It is very delicious. Any salmon lover should definitely give the salmon dish a try.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other entrée that we ordered was the lobster sliders. I did not know that this was a cold sandwich dish. I personally do not like cold sandwiches and also I only like my lobster done the traditional way so that you can taste the natural fresh sweet flavors of a good lobster. The lobster sliders had some kind of seasoning/dressing to it. Although they did not skimp on the lobster meat and they do give you a lot of big chunks of lobster meat with the sliders, the taste was not to my personal liking. I think I will stick with the salmon entrée and my lobster bisque in the future.\n",

      "Come check out this place when you're in town. You will not be disappointed.\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I never try to get my expectations up too high when it comes to high end steak houses, since i have been let down so many times before.  The ONLY thing that was really excellent here was the service by far!  The entire wait staff (which is only men) was wonderful!  The food was good... nothing to rant and rave about!  I had the\n",
      "Chateaubriand, and yes, it was good...but the table side presentation was the only GREAT thing about it, the steak itself was nothing i would go back for.  I strongly feel that the streak was just as good as the steak at Carve in the Cannery, and for half the price!  Overall, it was a nice experience, another thing to cross off my list, but honestly, no need for me to ever go back!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Steak was awesome but very pricey ..service not so good thet need  to  work on that..\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Started out with a rude front desk manager who was too busy to pay attention that we were there. Finally the girl who was working the desk came over to take care of us. Service at the table was overkill. Too many different people trying to take care of us. Prices were high but that is expected so no big deal. Steaks were overcooked. That is poor for a steak house like this one. Sent them back. Manager did not even have the decensy to visit the table to attend to the problem.   First time there and with all the other great places to eat it will be the last. Don't waste your time.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Simply perfection. It is an experience well worth the price. Impeccable service, amazing wine list, phenomenal melt in your mouth filet mignon and strip steaks, mouth watering, delectable side dishes. In a city full of fantastic and amazing gastro experiences, THIS gem is in my top ten list rotation. Go, go go, be pampered and leave so satisfied!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I have been on the lookout for the perfect filet for some time now.  My search has put this place on the top of my list.  After years of waiting I finally  was able to dine at the famed Delmonico Steakhouse in Vegas.  I was promised by steak loving friends that the filet was so perfect you didn't need a knife to cut it.\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife and I arrived a bit early so we could check out their bar.  The ambiance while very nice, was not what I had expected.  It was also not very busy which also threw me off a bit.  Anyway, we sat at the bar and I ordered up my usual (Goose martini with 3 blue cheese olives) and my wife ordered a glass of wine.  We chatted up the friendly bar tender, finished our drinks then headed into the main dining area to be seated.\n",
      "\n",
      "First we were given a ginormous wine list that took us 10 minutes to go through and another 10 minutes to decided what we wanted.  We settled on a very reasonably priced bottle and our waiter was not at all pissed that we didn't drop $100's on a bottle.\n",
      "\n",
      "First they bring you a small dinner roll/bread thing that was very unremarkable.  I liked it that they brought you a single roll so I couldn't eat 4 of them and ruin my dinner, but it just wasn't that good so I really didn't want more than one.  Probably for the best though.\n",
      "\n",
      "For an appetizer we shared the gulf shrimp cocktail which was excellent.  The shrimp were boiled in some creole stuff which gave them a very nice flavor.  They give you 4 large shrimp which is perfect for sharing although I could have eaten them all myself.  If you like super hot cocktail sauce then be sure to ask for a side of horseradish to heat it up some more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we had the Caesar  salad which is prepared tableside and is a 2 person portion.  While the salad was pretty good, I wouldn't order it again.  They add some spices to it that I just don't think belong in a salad and gave it an odd flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "As per our steakhouse usual, my wife and I split the filet and we both thought it was excellent.  It wasn't perfect, but probably one of the best I have ever had.  It was cooked perfectly, had excellent flavor and the rub they used wasn't too overpowering.  The steak was very tender but not the cut-with-your-fork kind of tender I am looking for.  At 9oz it was a perfect size to split and not feel overly full after our meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "For sides we ordered the veggie of the day (broccoli) and the fingerling potatoes.  I guess they were pretty good but I should have ordered a few of their less healthy options like creamed spinach or mashed potatoes.  My wife was in charge of the sides this time but next time I'm ordering something good.\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife and I are both suckers for desserts made in house so we had to try their pecan pie.  It was ok but I would try sometime else next time like the cheese cake.  I wasn't a fan of the crust but I was a fan of the size; it wasn't huge and was perfect for 2 people to share.\n",
      "\n",
      "After dinner my wife ordered a decaf coffee and for some reason I had absinthe.  The after dinner drink menu caught my eye because it had like 5 different selections of absinthe which is very unique.  I asked if I could do a sampler of them all but they said no.  Instead, I settled on one and it was very good.  I am not a very experienced absinthe drinker so I really couldn't tell you if it was any better than any other one but it was quite good......and strong.  I still have no idea why the heck I ordered it.\n",
      "\n",
      "My entire Delmonico experience was excellent.  Our entire waitstaff crew (there had to be 4 people waiting on us) were fast, friendly and helpful.  The price for the steak was reasonable and comparable to other steakhouses, but everything else was pretty high.  Anyway, I would definitely dine here again and honestly cannot wait to return.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Our experience at Delmonico's was good but just a tad bit disappointing so I can't give them 5 stars.    It's not that service was bad, in fact, it was better than most other restaurants but it was not up to the standards that I've come to expect from Emeril's server teams.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food was wonderful, as always, and we'll definitely be back for another visit.     The banana cream pie alone is worth a visit - it's ruined us for eating it anywhere else, ever!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] D is for Delmonico's!  I love steak!  I love Rib Eye Steak the most so I order it everywhere.  This ranks as the 3rd best Rib Eye flavor wise I've had behind Fleming's and Joe's Stone Crab IMO.  I had the mushrooms for sides which were good but not fantastic!  The Banana Cream Pie was exceptional.  Very thick and rich!  When you visit, dress like a High Roller!  =)\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] If you're looking for craptastic service and mediocre food at caviar prices, check out the Delmonico inside the Venetian!\n",

      "It started with the cocktail waitress who was so sassy it became bitchy, snipping short responses when our client asked a question. Then came our dinner server who was borderline rude. \"Are your seafood options listed here the only meat-free options you have? Most of them have sausage or some sort of meat in them,\" I inquired. \"Yep,\" was all he said before moving on... didn't even offer to remove an ingredient or help me out in any way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food was pretty tasteless. An heirloom tomato salad had the most bang for the appetizer buck, but at $18 for four slices of tomato and a splooge of burrata, I could concoct a very similar version from my local farmer's market for a fraction of the price. And it's not that price is that huge of a factor here; if you're going to Delmonico you are aware of the beefy tab that will come at the end of your meal... but when the service spits you aside, it's not worth it.\n",

      "If you're wondering why two stars and not one - the second star is for the wine list, which shone brighter than the boring white walls inside this sub-standard steak joint.\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] What a treat!  I expect a lot from a top end steak house and was skeptical that Emeril's name and reputation might be trumped up, but several friends said we had to try his Delmonico steak house.  They were right. \n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered the bone-in ribeye and the short ribs.  Both were easily the best examples of meat perfection we'd ever had - seasoned delicately and aged just right for an incredible buttery, nutty flavor that almost makes me think of buttered popcorn or butter toasted pecans. That delicate flavor was well paired with a bold garlic and cheese potato dish that we shared and a very nice bottle of Cain Concept from Napa Valley. \n",
      "\n",
      "The staff were very helpful and accommodating - we asked for their names to request them again - we had a \"team\" including Tom Baker and Braden Guy, both gave expert advice and were supremely attentive without smothering us. \n",

      "WILL RETURN ON NEXT LV VISIT FOR SURE!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] During a recent visit to Las Vegas, Delmonico Steakhouse was one of our top priorities. We had heard wonderful things about the food and this review was echoed when our driver commented that Delmonico was \"one of the best steakhouses in the world.\" Upon arriving we felt like VIP guests. The bar was sleek and high class. We were there to celebrate and friend's upcoming move and this was the perfect setting. The dining room was tastefully decorated and the minimalistic style allowed us to focus on the delicious food and good company. Among the appetizers we tried our favorites were the Foie Gras and Crabcakes. The appetizers set the tone for what would be an incredible dining experience. I suppose it should go without saying but the next course was STEAK! Filets and Bone-in Ribeyes were the popular picks with the guest of honor going for the Filet Oscar (a filet topped with jumbo crab meat), which was the group's favorite. The steaks lived up to their reputation. The sides were a la carte and were great for sharing. And it was all tied together with a Sineann Pinot Noir from the expansive wine list. We enjoyed the meal so much we did not get a chance to try the dessert menu. Service was outstanding. Our server, Michael, was very attentive and enhanced the entire experience. Everyone ranked our evening at Delmonico amongst their favorite dining experiences. The food, drinks and service were top-notch and it was the perfect send-off for a good friend.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] If you are going to pay $52 dollars for the most expensive meet cut, you expect high quality meat.  Instead I got a piece of meat that was 1/3 filled with fat, fat!! Come-on this is what you expect when you are eating at a college kid barbeque party.  While my gf order the shrimp pasta and that was unbelievably oily if you are going to cook with sausage one knows hit has natural oil so you dont need to fill up the frying pan with extra oil, someone needs to question the cooks they got.  Baked oyster was alright it was tasty, but buttery and oily as well, but still flavorful.\n",
      "  The only thing good about this place is the service.  The main waiter was very helpful when choosing a cocktail.  The servers where very friendly as well.\n",
      "  Bottom line: This place can cost over $150 person, depends what and quantity of order, skip the food at this place just come for cocktails.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place got two stars for service and cocktails.  Would have gotten four if I was describing a lounge or bar.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I really enjoyed the medium-rare rib eye as it was seasoned and cooked to perfection, but what I enjoyed even more were the pork chops!  Bone in tender chops cooked barely pink covered in a delicious, light sauce.  I'm getting moist just thinking about it.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] First impressions......Unfortunately, Delmonico Steakhouse made a huge mistake when they seated my party of three at the table right in front of the kitchen door with a restaurant that was less than half full.  Offensive and unacceptable.  The hostess ran in one direction and a staff member told us we would have to make our way back up to the front to deal with this issue when we told them that this would not work for us.  After a word with someone who claimed to be the manager at the front, we were reseated and promptly given complimentary truffle chips (that can solve any bad first impression).  The truffle chips are not to be missed.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Service-  Our server eventually warmed up and was pleasant.   He was so caught up in his speeches about different parts of the menu and recommendations, that it took some time to see his true personality.  He was also rushed, which was odd, as we had some menu questions.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Food-  The filet was magical.  This is the primary reason that the restaurant got 4 stars.  The creole seasoning and dab of BUTTER on the steak were an amazing and sinful treat.  Really delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cheese grits were delicious.  I was a bit less impressed with the creamed spinach.  The waiter said that it was better than CUT's version.  NO WAY!  Underwhelming.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The food was very good here. Very-overpriced and the ambience left a little to be desired. We were seated and served promptly and professionally at this restaurant. However, there was a screaming child immediately next to us. This child was so loud the other diners gasped in disbelief. The maitre 'd did not offer any apologies other than to say \"we are serving them quickly so they will leave\".  He did not seem overly concerned with our satisfaction.\n",
      "The food was good but not worth the expense. There are many other restaurants in Las Vegas. This one was not worth it. We're not going back.\n",

      "I tried other dishes my friends got and they weren't as good. My friends didn't really enjoy their filet mignon. I tried the pork chop and I thought the sauce was very salty. The bacon appetizer was good but tasted a bit salty as well. The creamed corn was very good but I didn't really like the bread crumbs on top of it. The creamed spinach was just ok.

      "We were seated promptly for our 830 reservation. I sat down and the guy put my napkin on my lap and stepped on my foot in the process. No big deal; I'm a klutz too. Shortly thereafter, a waiter appeared, informed us that we'd have three servers that night. He then asked us if we'd like bottled or tap water, and then asked if we wanted a wine list. We answered and he went off to take care of it. Not 30 seconds later someone else (one of our other servers, I assume) showed up and gave us the exact same spiel. We answered the same way. \n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after, the first guy appeared with the wine list, which was literally 25 pages long. Ok, I both love me some wine and understand that this is a nice place, but a wine list that long is overwhelming. Yes, they had a page with Kevin's (the sommelier, I assume) picks, but still. \n",
      "\n",
      "20 minutes after we received the wine list, our server finally showed up to take our wine and food orders. We decided to split a ribeye and some potato gratin. I also got the gumbo, which was served promptly along with our wine. \n",
      "\n",
      "As I said before, everything was delicious. The wine was great, the gumbo was extremely flavorful, the ribeye was tender and wonderful, and I also loved the potato gratin. However, when we got our food, I asked the server if he could give us the check a little early so we wouldn't have to rush to make our show (we were cutting it close, especially with the time it took for the server to come take our order). He insisted we'd have plenty of time and refused to give us the check. This is because he wanted to offer us dessert after our meal. Fine. Whatever. Still annoying. \n",

Our waters were constantly refilled before it was even half empty.\n",

It was dry-aged 14 days, which you could tell when you sliced the meat with your knife. Tender, flavorful, delicious! I loved that the sides were encrusted with pepper and salt. My other friend ordered the filet-mignon, which she could not finish. I loved how it melted in your mouth and it was also very flavorful. We got the country smashed potatoes, the baked idaho potato, and the roasted fingerling potatoes. The roasted fingerling potatoes tasted the best. I thought it was perfect the way it was salted. The other 2 potatoes didn't stand out to me. \n",

I have to say something about the décor - it was too plain and sterile and I expected a little more character from this establishment.  I would have added some wood paneling or some framed mirrors.  But the food was worth it.  We ordered the New Orleans BBQ Shrimp, Butternut Squash Ravioli, Traditional New Orleans Gumbo, and of course the 16 oz Rib Eye steak.  Our side dishes included the Country Smashed Potato, Delmonico Creamed Spinach, Buttered Fresh Asparagus, and Sauteed Garlic Mushrooms.  All the dishes we ordered were delicious.  Our steak was medium rare and it was sooo good.  The meat was tender with the right amount of fatty goodness.  My favorite sides were the asparagus (cooked just right, not over or under cooked) and the mushrooms.  The creamed spinach was a little too salty for me.  They added a nice touch to my birthday by serving complimentary appetizer and dessert (mango sorbet)\n",

We ordered off of the prix fix menu. Make sure you ask the server for this menu because it's only listed on a sign outside but not found anywhere on the menu. I had the tomato soup with ricotta grilled cheese. By far, best tomato soup I have ever had. My boyfriend and I also ordered different types of steaks. We ordered them to be cooked medium rare. His came out perfect- pink all the way through, juicy tender. However, mine was VERY rare- like almost a shade of blue. For a steakhouse, this is VERY disappointing. The other issue with this is after we received our food no one checked in and it took a while for me to flag down one of our servers (we had three servers/workers for our table). So my boyfriend was almost done with his steak before we were even checked on and received a new one. Manager did come over and apologize for but a steakhouse in Vegas, I feel the temperature of a steak has to be on point. \n",

After he made a point of stating the time, and the time our reservation was, we were escorted to our table. The decor almost feels cave-like, which worked for a steakhouse. The place was packed and it took a little longer than fine dining protocol allows for to get our menus. Our waitress was a sweetheart and made suggestions for us, although she seemed swamped with tables. \n",
      "I decided on the lobster bisque and the petite fillet Mignon. The lobster bisque was ok, nothing special, which was sad, since I watch the food network 24/7 and love Emeril, (I expected more from his restaurant). My fillet was a little overcooked for medium rare, and really had nothing special about it. No flavor to set it apart from a fillet I'd get from Costco and make on the grill myself. The boy loved his steak, so I guess the meal was a success, but having been to N9NE, I wouldn't come back here.

It was cooked to the requested temperature (rare), and it tasted great. My beef with their beef is simple: it could have been served with a hotter searing, on a hotter plate, and in a larger portion size. For the price, I expect a larger steak than this, and for that reason, I would probably go to Mastro's next time. \n",

The bread they serve here is the most atrocious bread ever. It is similar to a croissant shaped like a muffin. It looks like it would be delicious, but it is so greasy and is worse than day old croissants from your cheap grocery store. The only saving grace of this night was the ribeye steak,  which was really fantastic, as was the sea bass. The special prime bone in was pretty terrible - we asked for medium and got well done. Don't even get me started on the salad with the greasiest non-olive oil dressing... yuck! They were also kind of confused when I asked for vinegar to eat the salad..\n",

The table beside us arrived after us and recieved their wine and food before us! They recieved excellent service, getting a amuse bouch, and all served at the same time! We were treated like dishwashers. I thought the food was ok, crabcake was decent but lacked simple seasoning salt and pepper! I thought they would at least make there own bread, but no. The ribeyes were charred black and had no seasoning, filet was ok but lacked seasoning. Gnocchi was great but a little salty. All in all food lacked seasoning, waiter was a asshole, all though the manager was cool I will never step foot in there again!!!!!!!!\n",

He asked me what I meant.  I clarified by saying what types of wines are used to make the blend.  He rattled off one variety and then said \"and I think a Cabernet is in there\".  Lamont made no offer to explain or recommend any other wines.  We ordered two glasses of Malbec, our appetizer and entrees.  My husband asked Lamont if he could get a side of garlic butter.

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Hands down best steak (ribeye) I've ever ever had. Nice seasoning and aged steak. Try garlic sauteed wild mushrooms and potato gratin. Yummy. Wish I was eating it right now.. Drool...\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Had dinner here about a year ago. Great service, good ambience. I ordered the Colorado Rack of Lamb, it was delicious. Also a bonus; sizable, clean restrooms.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Awesome Steaks! I have never seen a piece of prime rib so big! Nothing jumped out  at  me as exceptional but over all it was very tasty. Waiter was very knowedgable about the wine list which was a plus!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] It wasnt the best ive had but it was good. I like my steak medium but it was alittle on the burnt side. I didnt want to complain since it was still good and edible. \n",

      "The service was great.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We spent our 24th wedding anniversery in Vegas and had to make a return to Delmonico since we had not been there sice 2008. It was great then and just as great this time.\n",

      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Our party of six dined at Delmonico for my 50th birthday celebration.   In short, the service was outstanding!  Our head waiter was Michael and the manager on the floor was Vincent.   We also had at least two others who served us.  All were very professional and patient. Our party was not the eaisiest to serve that night, but what happens in Vegas...!\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously food tastes are very subjective.  My bone in ribeye and twice baked potato were great.  I did not care too much for the chicken and waffle dish my wife had... neither did she.  The shrimp appetizer was a 10, as was the crab dish.   The desserts... Creme Brulee, banana creme pie and chocolate cake were very good also.  Overall, a very nice experience.  We will return.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] About 2 years ago, I had dreamed of eating steak at Delmonico's.  The reputation of this place exceeds my expectations; and, as such, is my dilemma with this place.  Delmonico's is Emeril lagasse's steak house.  It is his prime choice, so-to-speak, and it has one of the prime locations between the Palazzo and the Venetian, right in front of the Blue Man Group entrance, across from V-bar, B&B, and next door to Aquaknox.  I've walked by this place numerous times and always wanted to eat there.  Suffice to say, in the past two years, I have.  In short, I have eaten at Delmonico's 6 times.  Not bad for someone that gives this place 3-stars.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Pros: \n",
      "Wine list is expansive and can be very intimidating.  However, I question the knowledge of one of the staff when they recommended a pinot for our bone-in ribeye.  I know a little bit about wine, well, who I am I kidding, I pretend to know a lot.  Enough to the point that I didn't think I'd want a pinot.  However, it was his recommendation and I thought I would go with it.  It was definitely a pinot.  Very disappointed since the body of it didn't fit right with our bone-in ribeye (which was my concern to begin with).\n",
      "The steak is choice (to steal my favorite John Hughes film).\n",
      "Can sit large groups fairly easily.\n",
      "Will sit a table fairly late (almost 11pm on a Friday night).\n",
      "Excellent sides.\n",
      "They are fairly attentive with the service.\n",
      "The scotch list is reasonable.  However, I do usually get a vodka martini with blue cheese stuffed olives (and they hit it pretty good).  \n",
      "They do have a chef's table near the kitchen.  For a heavy trafficked weekend, I believe you have to book well into 3-months in advance (numbers change based on availability).  I am interested in trying this because I think it would be a blast to have a bunch of friends, drinking out of a magnum, and eating some good steak (but I'm not that organized nor do I have an event to do that with).  Well, who am I kidding, I don't even have that many friends.  Ha!  Anyways...\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons: \n",
      "I always get the bone-in ribeye and each time I've eaten it, the seasoning (which I believe is a cajun based creole seasoning) is slightly different each time.  In some cases the seasoning can be too much and in others, its not enough.  There just isn't any consistency.\n",
      "All but one time I've eaten here someone has gotten the ribeye too rare or too well-done.  The fact that they can't get this right concerns me.  You are a steakhouse; get it right; its what you are supposed to be good at!\n",
      "The decor is more monastery like.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The first time I ate here, I gave it 4-stars (my meal was great, my girlfriends meal wasn't cooked right).  If they clean up their act and make things tight and organized, I think Delmonico's is a 4-star steakhouse.  The steak is pretty tasty.  Its perfectly okay to pick up the bone and start gnawin on it.  Well, within reason of course.  However, it has too much inconsistency between day to day operations and meals.  To be fair, I'd still come and eat here (cause I believe the steak is an excellent quality of meat) but with the competition being so tight in Vegas, I've started to venture out.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] i had an amazing dinner here the other night with a friend.  In often too-busy Vegas, it's nice to find a nice, quiet, comfortable, spacious restaurant like this one, tucked in the Restaurant Row of the Venetian.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food was very good -- I'd recommend the heirloom tomato salad and the lobster bisque.  The Filet was great as was the bone-in ribeye.  The wine list is amazing with a very nice collection of French wine, top burgundies in particular.  And if you're in the mood to drop $500-$750 on a bottle, you can actually great a very good value on wine that would cost much more elsewhere.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Delmonico's is easily a 5-star restaurant, but not because there is a famous name (Emeril Lagasse) associated with the restaurant -- but because the food is simply exceptional. This is fine dining without the pretentiousness of stuffy, overpriced, mini-portion restaurants. \n",
      "\n",
      "We happened to be staying at the Venetian Hotel & Casino and made reservations to Delmonico's, which is on the premises. There was about a 1-minute wait and we were quickly whisked away to a candlelit table. The restaurant itself is very simple yet elegant; nothing over the top, flashy or obnoxious. The lighting is perfect; not too dark and the wait staff is extremely attentive and prompt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Delmonico's is known for their steak; the bone-in rib eye steak. This slab of meat is prime and comes with a nice price tag. If you're at Delmonico's -- ya might as well go for it, chump!\n",
      "\n",
      "For starters, I had the Lobster Bisque Soup; thick, creamy and packed with flavor. I absolutely loved it! Best Lobster Bisque I have ever had. It came adorned with a polenta type cake in the middle. I am not sure if it was polenta or dried shrimp cake -  or even bread, but it didn't matter as it all happily made its way down my belly. \n",
      "\n",
      "We also tried the crab meat cake; fresh chunks of crab atop a puff pastry and dressed with tomatoes, lima beans, asparagus and all sorts of good spring veggies. Amazing! \n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to try the Rack of Lamb with the Twice Baked Potatoes. Jeff went with the Rib Eye Steak and Baked Potato. The Lamb was head-spinning! Topped with a rich sauce and truffles! Perfectly cooked and moist and tender and gaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh! I can't rave enough. The steak was just as good -- even the fatty pieces were delicious. \n",
      "\n",
      "The food, the service, the atmosphere, the attention to detail, the $25 corking fee -- all was worth the price. Definitely a place to experience while out in SIN CITY!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I decided to take my wife to Las Vegas for our first anniversary.  She'd never been to Las Vegas, but had always wanted to go.  She asked me if we could get dressed up and go somewhere nice one of the nights we were there.  So after doing a little bit of research I stumbled upon Delmonico.  With a name like Emeril Lagasse associated with the place it had to be good right? I went to the website and looked over their menu.  The prices can be very intimidating to someone not used to a fine dining experience.  I really appreciated that the prices were on the menu on the website, because I would not have planned ahead otherwise, and might have choked when I saw them.  However, we only have one first anniversary so I decided we should go for it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I called and made a reservation about 5 days in advance, the person on the phone was extremely courteous and helpful.  She asked me if we were celebrating a special occasion.  After I explained it was our first anniversary, she said that she would note it on the reservation.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We arrived at Delmonico at about 7:55pm, we had reservations for 8pm.  We were greeted at the front desk by a young woman.  She immediately said \"Happy Anniversary\" and asked us to have a seat in the lounge.  At about 8:05pm our name was called and we were led back to our table.  A table for four quickly became a table for two.  All the extra silverware, plates, and glasses were whisked away.  The serving staff was beyond courteous, even offering us black napkins due to our clothes being black.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Drink orders were taken and suddenly a plate was placed in front of us. \"Courtesy of the chef, for your anniversary.\" said the server.  It was a crostini, with slightly cooked piece of beef, some blue cheese dressing, and chives topped with olive oil.  I hate blue cheese but I ate it anyway, and it was quite good.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The server asked my wife about wine, and my wife said she liked it but was not very familiar with the types of wine.  The server asked my wife a few questions and came back with a glass of wine my wife loved, and a sample of another kind of wine she might like to have in the future, my wife loved the sample as well.  \n",
      "\n",
      "When it came time to order, my wife order the heirloom tomato appetizer that they have.  It basically sliced heirloom tomatoes with cheese and red onions, drizzled with oil and balsamic.  She loved it.  She also got the Filet Mignon, and buttered asparagus.  Her steak was amazing, I tried a bite of it.  It was cooked perfectly.  It had a little spice to it from the seasoning, all around it was the best Filet Mignon I've ever experienced.  The asparagus was cooked perfectly.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the Delmonico signature cut, a bone in Ribeye.  Ribeye is my favorite cut of steak by far.  I've been eating primarily Ribeye for so long it's hard to believe that I was ever happy with other cuts.  I also ordered their take on creamed corn.  The Ribeye was worth the whole trip, it was the by far the best Ribeye I have ever encountered and probably ever will.  It was cooked perfectly.  It had the proper amount of fat that should be expected with a Ribeye.  It was amazing.  The corn was really good also.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our server then brought us another complimentary dish from the kitchen, cherry sorbet.  Written in chocolate around the outside of the bowl was \"Happy Anniversary\".  It was pretty good, I'm not a big sorbet person, however please remember, it was free.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Even with the complimentary dessert my wife and I couldn't pass up a chance to try one of the menu dessert items.  We chose butterscotch Creme Brulee.  It came with 3 butterscotch/chocolate chip cookies on the side.  It was amazing, and probably our new standard for Creme Brulee.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all our experience was awesome.  The food was outstanding and the service was great.  My glass never got empty.  Every time I finished a dinner roll another roll was promptly placed on the plate in it's place.  After the 2nd or 3rd roll, I looked over towards my wife, grinning.  The server saw this and quietly said with a smile on her face, \"You know that is going to keep happening.\" I told my wife that when I was over the rolls, I probably needed to leave a bite on the plate to avoid a new roll. It was funny.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I would recommend Delmonico to anyone who is in Vegas and looking for a great place to go.  I would encourage anyone who does go to go with the expectation or a fantastic meal.  I think if you go in with the idea of being critical, you will probably find something to complain about, as the couple at the next table did.  They had multiple issues, and sent a few things back to the kitchen.  Remember that food preparation is an art not a science, and enjoy.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] + Food was GREAT! 5 stars. (ordered bone-in ribeye, tomato soup, fingerling potatoes, twice baked potato, & broccoli) All Delicious!\n",
      "\n",
      "- Service was 4 stars...At an upscale restaurant like this, I was expecting the server's to be friendly and attentive but they were just \"okay\".\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This review is only for the front lounge area as we were in for drinks and appetizers.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Drinks were fine, service was totally average...not great but not bad either.  We ordered an assortment of appetizers to share.  Butternut squash ravioli, truffle chips (weird to order potato chips at a nice restaurant, but we did not based on waitress recommendation) and shrimp were wonderful, the pork not so much....it was very mushy and gamy tasting for some reason. I don't consider myself a food snob, but I took one bite and did not eat any more.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We booked this place based on yelp reviews and now I can see why they are mixed.  I would for sure give this place another shot if we were in Las Vegas AND in the Venetian/Palazzo area.  That said, I would not go out of my way to dine here again.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Bone in ribeye was incredible. Even offered a special \"book\" of scotch selections.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] For an upscale steakhouse its great, I've had Ruth's Chris, Morton's, etc and its hard to say which is best. The steak, Bone-in Ribeye, was beautifully cooked, seasoned well, and tasted magnificent. But that isn't why this spot is so memorable! The unique flavors of the rest of the meal is the reason why I would go back. For appetizer I had the BBQ shrimp which was deep, smoky, rich, had a little kick, and was out of this world, definitely something you finish and contemplate ordering another. Lobster bisque was phenomenal, nice big chunks of meat, smooth explosive flavor. The sides were on point too but nothing extraordinary. They also had this crisp local beer form Louisiana called Abita Amber which was awesome. Overall I left only complaining about how stuffed I was.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Our bad experience started with the lady who answered when I called to set a resv. She sounded like she wasn't very happy and didn't make me feel good about planning to go to Delmonicos.  \n",
      "We get there and the hostess simply said \"follow me\" she did not make eye contact or even ask \"how's your evening?\" She walked so fast to our table it was hard to keep up.  She sat us, gave us a napkin, said nothing at all, and walked away.  (Also they only have white napkins.. I'm used to fine dining where your napkin, either white or black, be offered to go with your ensemble.)\n",
      "Next, our server(s), didn't seem to care that we were dining there.  Not sure if they judged based on skin color, age, and style of clothes, but it felt like they did.  After offering us drinks and giving us menus, it was about an 8 to 10 minute wait to see our server again.. Mind you that we'd chosen what we'd have for dinner and had our menus closed a majority of that time.\n",
      "Overall for service from beginning til end was way below par for such a place.  We did not feel welcomed nor that they gave 2 funks about us.\n",
      "FOOD:\n",
      "My bone in rib eye was ordered medium and came out medium well, which made it particularly dry and tough.  My spouses bone in rib eye was cooked correctly (medium), but was nothing to call home about.\n",
      "I ordered my steak Oscar style.  The asparagus was the highlight of our dinner and the crab seemed a but overlooked and dry.\n",
      "We also had a lobster tail each, which came de-shelled and on top of the rib eye.  Drawn butter was brought out but lemon was not, nor offered.\n",
      "We had the New Orleans style creamed spinach.. The only \"new Orleans\" about it was the name.  The spinach tasted fresh but it was about a 3.5/5 on overall taste and quality.\n",
      "For the price there are many better options in Las Vegas (Mastro's ocean club; the capital grille, del frisco's..).  \n",
      "We will surely never return.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Great ribeye steak.  Cooked perfectly.  Was a little disappointed in the \"sides\".  Overall good experience but would probably choose Bouchon 1st.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] First let me say that this has been my favorite Las Vegas restaurant for several years.  That is what makes this review so difficult for me to write.  My last two trips to Delmonico's have left me looking for a new favorite.  We were there Friday night for our anniversary.  We were seated at a table that was next table a food staging area.  We had servers all around our table all night  prepping food for other diners.  It was very irritating.  The food was ok but not great.  The service was terrible.  We asked for horseradish sauce when our steaks arrived and actually got it when we were just about to finish our meals.  We actually had to look for someone to refill our drinks on several occasions.  I love this place but I will not be back.  Our bill was over $400 for 4 people and I am ok with that but we got $75 Longhorn's type service and I cannot live with that.  Sorry Delmonico's.  I am out.  Need a new favorite Vegas restaurant.  Suggestions?\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Very big portions and the service is amazing! The mashed potatoes and mushrooms were so good! It's expensive so make sure you only take the person that you really really REALLY (did I mention really) love lol!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I really love that it's classy yet not pretentious. You go in to this beautifully open dining area, but you don't feel over/underdressed. Servers were waiting around to cater to your needs, but not in that anxiety-inducing I'm watching over you way.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was our vday pick and frankly i was glad they didn't have a fixed menu. Being at a steakhouse i felt obligated to get the steak! I was also very appreciative of the fact that I didn't have to eat mine drenched in butter. My ribeye had a very nice crust of charred creole seasoning, with a lovely red center. Those smashed potatoes could not have been any creamier! I love when they serve the potatoes in that little pot. Honey got the lamb and it was deliciously tender, it practically melted in my mouth. \n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing out of the ordinary or spectacular, but a solid choice for date nite or a nice dinner out.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Came here for my 21st birthday with my family. Was almost the best steak I had in my life. We also had some good wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Came back here for a 2nd time recently with my sister before we headed off to a concert, and it wasn't as good this time. Not sure what it was. Portions are large, and prices still relatively expensive, but it just didn't sweep me off my feet like the first time.\n",

      "\n",
      "My wife and I both ordered filets cooked medium. The steaks came out super fast and were unfortunately super rare. My wife decided to eat hers, but I sent mine back. My steak came back closer to medium rare than medium, and the flavor was gone. I waited at least ten minutes for the steak to come back, and it was a miss. On top of that, my filet's cut was poor. The sides were fine - mushrooms and twice baked potato.\n",
      "\n",
      "I kind of felt that the kitchen and management really blew this for us. At a place with a price point like this, walking in just before closing shouldn't impact the food quality. I feel like the kitchen wanted the steak out ASAP so they could shut down for he night. On top of that, no manager came to say a word about the mistake, and nothing was done to compensate for it - no comped drink or dessert or even a \"sorry\" from the management. I think that this is inexcusable considering this is an Emeril restaurant and is quite pricey.\n",

      "Not sure we will return, which is too bad because we are fond of the place from past visits.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Dinner was fabulous. The bone in ribeye was perfectly done, the filet was blue as requested, not an easily done prep-and spit on. The grits, as well as the creamed spinach very tasty. The banana cream pie a perfectly yummy dessert for two. Well worth the price.\n",

Also, i went in at 8:30 for my meal and for a table of 4 i think we left like close to 11. It wasn't that the service was slow, the atmosphere and ambiance was just right to forget time and enjoy your meal and the people your with.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Great steak house. The spinach salad with bacon and a fried egg is to die for. I always get the fillet and French fries. The fries are not in the menu but are AMAZING. All in all one of my favorite steak houses in Vegas. A must try.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Very good, and worth the price!  All food was very good and service outstanding.  Perfect location if going to shows in Venetian or Palazzo.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This was by far the worst meal I have ever had.  Not steak,   Meal!  I went with a group of 4, only 1 steak was cooked correctly and it was super fatty. I had a filet ordered medium to medium well black, it showed up well done with no char whatsoever.  My friend ordered hers blue and it showed up rare. My husband's was fine but like I said super fatty. The other friends was over cooked as well along with the snottiest looking disgusting foie gras I have ever seen. Bottom line_ you go to Vegas to have a great meal and it sucked.  All of it sucked. Go somewhere else for $100pp.\n",

      "I had high hopes for Delmonico, as many had said some great things.  Being an Emeril restaurant I figured it was just another celebrity chef restaurant, so I had my reservations.  The place was well decorated and had a great vibe.  The food was up to par and certain items had great taste, such as the lobster bisque.  I was hoping for more with the wilted spinach salad, but it was still OK.  The complimentary amuse bouche was a nice touch, tasted like a truffle cream of mushroom.  Now the steak, everyone says to go with the bone-in ribeye, so that's what I got.  Tasty, but needed a bit more flavor.  Not as buttery and smooth as other high end steakhouses.  Service could use some attention for a restaurant of this caliber.  Forgot our truffle potato chips and service went downhill with the way they took our plates and such.\n",

There have been times, where I try other steak houses when in Vegas, but I always leave saying. \"Not as good as Delmonico's\"... My order is usually the same each time; start with the Truffle Chips, then Lobster Bisque (mmmmmmmm),  sides Cream of Spinach and Cream of Corn... then the BONE IN RIB EYE - MEDIUM....    \n",

      "The distinguishing characteristic here is the service.  We had 10:00pm reservation on Valentine's day and were flying in to Vegas to meet friends for a weekend getaway (got that? good).  Our flight out of SFO was delayed and we ended up arriving at the restaraunt at 10:48, long after we should have been seated etc.  Our waitress was the essence of efficiency; without missing a beat she let us know that last orders were due at 11:00.  They key here was she always made us feel like she was on \"our team\" rather than making us feel as if our lateness at created an inconvienience for her.  She helped all six of us get seated and get our orders in \"before the bell\" (as it were).  She got a $100+ tip for being a pro.\n",

This was the ribeye steak, but the bone-in ribeye ordered by one of my partners in crime was equally well-prepared and duly appreciated.  My wife thought her crab-stuffed halibut (wrapped in a potato skin) was good (but not great?).  \n",

I think we all had at least one drink and the girls split a bottle of wine, one desert and a few coffees were ordered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom Line:\n",
      "The service here was friendly and professional.  The staff make you feel welcome and are eager to please.  The food is extremely good and a decent value (it is Vegas after all).  Go here if you like steak and are willing to pay a little extra.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Its a fancy steakhouse in Vegas.  Sure it was great, the food was good the service was superb and the wine selection was almost too much to deal with, but its expensive.  hey its a fancy steakhouse in Vegas.  So it lives up to its name.  If you are looking for a great night out for steak this is as good a selection as any.  Just be prepared to pay about $100-$150/person if you are going to be on wine.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The place? Comfortable yet elegant.\n",
      "The service? Spot on.\n",
      "The food? Really good, but...\n",
      "\n",
      "Something was lacking. I had been wanting to try one of Emeril Lagasse's restaurants for awhile and was really excited to dine at Delmonico, but the food didn't blow me away like I had expected it to. Their gumbo was good, but lacked a bit of salt. Their pork chops were good, but could have been a little more tender. My friend noted that the texture of the steak was a bit off. Their desserts were good, but the chocolate cake was kind of dry. Everything was \"good\", but nothing was great. Wait...I take that back - their dinner rolls were delicious! \n",
      "\n",
      "Although I really enjoyed my Delmonico experience overall, I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon. (I have yet to find a steakhouse that I like better than Mastro's!)\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I will admit as I write this review that I am not the target clientele for Delmonico's. I don't eat red meat and Delmonico's is a steakhouse. I went with a group for a friend's birthday, but wasn't concerned about finding food because I've never been to a steakhouse that doesn't have at least one fantastic chicken or fish option. Umm...I found that place. The only non-red meat option on the menu was a bacon-wrapped halibut and I don't eat pork either (I know, I'm annoying). I asked if I could have the halibut without bacon and they told me they would have to unwrap it, but sure. Which meant my ridiculously expensive dinner consisted of a dry rock which might have once been halibut that tasted strongly of bacon. Now, I know it was a steakhouse and I shouldn't hold it against them that they aren't prepared to deal with a semi-vegetarian, but they should at least be prepared to make halibut that doesn't have the consistency of a rock. And I also wasn't impressed with the service. They got down the whole 8 waiters at a time delivering everybody's food thing, but our waiter wasn't particularly knowledgeable about the wine or the menu, except to push \"Emeril's specialties.\" And seeing as how Emeril isn't actually back there, I don't really care what are his specialities. The decor does make the most of an underground space, but the lack of windows made me genuinely claustrophobic by the end of the night. Overall, I was really dissapointed. I'd give it one star, but I don't think that's fair because, again, I'm not their target audience. But that doesn't mean I'm not paying as much as everybody else!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Had dinner with the guys so we reserved the chef table in back with wine pairing and a tour of the restaurant. It was definitely the best dinner experience I had in Las Vegas. \n",
      "\n",
      "One of the dishes was a quail which I normally am not fond of but they did such a good job I devoured it. The wine pairing was excellent and they were generous with their pours. I even took a full glass back to my room at the end of the night. Excellent service and food! My new favorite place!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] in a nutshell:\n",
      "\n",
      "-best service I've ever received in a restaurant.  They treat you like you are the owner, totally personal and attentive without ever being intrusive.  The wait team is on the ball with every facet of service\n",
      "\n",
      "-Food was fantastic of course.  Got the bone-in filet (10oz) which was cooked perfectly, the missus got the filet medallions, which was a bit misleading as these were small steaks, not \"medallions\"!! Lot of food.  The side dishes are quite large, suitable for 3 or 4, so a party of 2 will have more than enough ordering just 1 side dish.  \n",
      "\n",
      "-The room is very nice. Uber minimal, nothing on the walls, just nicely sculptured archways and ceilings.  Very nice environment for a phenomenal meal.   The prices are high, esp considering side dishes are all a la carte, but nothing astronomical.  Figure around $100/person for a starter, entree, non-alcoholic drink, dessert, tax and 20% tip.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] My group and I were congregating outside in the bar area prior to our reservation and I was called by name to be seated which was very nice.  The dining room is actually more like one large hall way with two adjoining rooms.  You get about 2-3 waiters per table and they offer very good and attentive service overall.  So anyways on to the food review.  I ended up ordering the tuna/salmon tartare appetizer and the bone-in rib steak medium rare.  The Tuna and salmon both were very tasty but the portion was rather small.  For $18, I would expect a little bit more.  Now on to the reason why we dined here....my steak came out and it looked giant.  The overall taste of the meat was only decent at best.  I was really expecting a more flavorful piece of meat.  Maybe they forgot to season it or just didn't put enough of emeril's spice?  I could tell though the meat quality was very, very good.  They advertise wet-age steaks, but I much prefer dry-aged steaks.  Too bad my steak was only just okay and for $52 I didn't feel ripped off but more disappointed.  I thought about ordering the bone-in NY strip and regret it now.  I'd sacrifice little fat and marbling for some more flavor. The side dishes that our group shared were also just okay, nothing spectacular but not bad either.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I was part of a group of six people having a business dinner and was really looking forward eating at this establishment. The service was very good and noise level was acceptable wherein it was easy to carry on a conversation.  I had the BBQ shrimp as my appetizer which was very good.  But as to the main entree, I was very disappointed in the quality of the NY strip.  This piece of meat was described as prime but in reality I thought it was more of a select grade ... I have had choice from the grocery store that was more tender.  Initially, I thought maybe my steak was an anomaly and did not want to complain since were invited out to dinner. However, then  another person in our party also stated his steak was very tough and was only able to eat about a quarter of his steak ... Gave up and moved on to eat only the side dishes, which were very good I may say.\n",
      "\n",
      "We all shared the desserts ... I really enjoyed the Banana Cream pie.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though there were some good things about this restaurant still rated it lower based on the poor quality of prime steak I had relative to the cost of the steak ... In essence it still was not worth the dining experience even though I was not the one paying.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This place was EXCELLENT!  We were on the hunt for a great steakhouse and we definitely found it here.  The food and drinks were excellent and there were many options to choose from.  One thing I find in many upscale steakhouses is a somewhat limited menu with only a handful of entrees and appetizers to choose from.  Delmoico's has an expansive menu and everything was delicious.  the atmosphere and food made for a great night out... definitely try if you are looking for a nice night out (for steak) in Vegas!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Although very expensive (my chicken was 36, husbands steak 50), you get what you pay for. Great food and service. Left full and pleased.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I come here often.  Still one of my favorite steakhouses in Vegas.  The restaurant ascetic is less dolled up than Cut or Carnevino, however I enjoy the simplicity of the place.  Think underground wine tunnel, that's the decor you should expect.  Love the apple cured bone in bacon and bone in rib eye.  Last visit, Service was a little sub-par.  In a town that tries to pinch you for every nickel bringing in our own wine, a 2001 Peju ($200+ bottle) from our personal cellar may have hurt his pocket.  Living here in Vegas probably raised my standard of Service, especially when you take home six figures as a Professional Server.   Yup.  It is a career here vs a job for most places in the world.  Without corkage ($35), the bill was still $300+ for 2 people.  We enjoy our food!\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] This review is where I am sorry that you can only assign 5 stars because there are not enough stars to convey how much I adored this meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The atmosphere is perfect in noise level, pleasing color palate and space.  You are relaxed when you eat here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The staff is welcoming and prideful in the job without sounding pretentious, the perfect blend of professional and friendly.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The food-OH THE FOOD- the spinach salad, basically heaven on a plate,  tender spinach with a well balanced sherry vinaigrette and praline bacon pieces.  Let's just say, I was sorry that I offered to split it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The filet and bone-in rib eye (our selections) were grilled to perfection, and I mean, perfection!!  Don't let the creole crust intimidate you, it is not overpowering and they're not ruining a beautiful cut with \"stuff\".  The twice-baked potato was hearty and delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "They will suggest the banana cream pie, which looks great, but I chose the pecan pie in an oatmeal shortbread crust.  This was so beyond fantastic in its tender and unique crust to the mellow nutty sweetness of the filling.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could seriously go on and on about this meal. I love to cook and I love to eat so it is a perfect evening when I feel like there is nothing I would change about the meal or think that I could have saved a ton of money and cooked myself.  Those thoughts NEVER ran through my mind.  So, next time I am in Vegas, I will return as soon as I get off the plane.  cannot wait.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Had the most amazing dinner here with my wife the other night.  Very fancy restaurant, but gives off a warm ambiance.  We were looking for a great meal to spend $150-200 on, and we hit it out of the park with this place located in the Venetian shoppes.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Quick rundown:\n",
      "\n",
      "Food was absolutely amazing.  My wife had the BBQ Salmon and she is still talking about it days later.  I had the rib-eye and I have to say that it was on par with any other steak I have had, including my fav Maestro's.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Service was what you would expect from an establishment like this, impeccable.  Constant checking in and recommendations that were absolutely perfect!  Was impressed when I asked for a wine recommendation with my steak I was not told the most expensive bottle they had, rather the one that went best with the meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall if you are in Vegas and looking for a classy and elegant dinner that will cost you, give this place a try.  I don't believe you will be disappointed.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We went for lunch.  And we were super early, the first ones there.  So maybe that contributed to the lack of enthusiasm that we started out with.  Our waiter was very nice but he didn't quite seem all there at first.  He asked me if I wanted a side of potatoes after I order a burger that comes with fries.  He walked away before we could order drinks and we had to call him back.\n",
      "\n",
      "But after the initial turbulence, everyone settled in and we had a good meal.  I started with the gumbo which was perfectly fine, but it lacked a little soul for me.  For my entree I ordered the burger, as mentioned.  I just wasn't in the mood for steak for lunch or any of the other entrees for that matter.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The burger was freakin' awesome.  It didn't have any weird toppings, just the standard lettuce, tomato, mayo maybe, whatever.  But this thing was a MONSTER.  That burger must have been about 3/4 of a pound.  It stood about 8 inches high and was delivered with a steak knife plunged into it to keep it all put together.  There was no way I was eating this thing with my hands.  This was a knife-and-forker all the way.  It was so much fun digging into that sexy hot beefy mama.  The fries were awesome too.  It's not often that I find a burger that I fall in love with but this is one that I will cherish forever.  5 star burger all the way.  Who needs a steak when you've got one of these babies.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Five star service the bone in rub eye was a good size and so favor full and tender that I ate the whole thing , the strawberry shortcake was unbelievable . Unlike anything I had before, my wife loved her scallop and macadanina bread pudding. In fact. It was the olmy bread pudding I liked\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] I REALLY wanted to love Delmonicos. I made reservations weeks ahead of time and booked our room at venetian because of Delmonicos.\n",
      "The food was good. It just wasn't amazing.  I could have made everything we ordered at home.  It just wasn't special. \n",
      "The service was really awkward.  We were seated at a table by the area they prep the plates before bringing them to the table. That was annoying.  Even more obnoxious was how the servers would lean against the wall 2 feet from our table and stare.\n",
      "Lastly our desert menu was plopped down on the table and then the server walked away.  \n",
      "Womp Womp!!!!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] We started off getting drinks at the bar as we waited for the rest of party to arrive.  Let me get this out, I love Spago and go there every time to meet my fav. chef, Eric Klein, and I was NOT impressed when the bartender starting dissing all the Wolfgang Puck restos.  I mean, I didn't like CUTthat much, but that's a diff review. So we kinda started off on the wrong foot. Nonetheless, the drinks were good. My boyfriend's mojito had a real sugar cane in it so I can't complain about that at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shared the 2 person fancy-shmancy made tableside Caesars salad and can only say that it tastes exactly like a caesar salad that would've been made in the kitchen.  I ordered the filet. Ate 1/2, passed it my boyfriend so he can finish it.  The wine selection was impressive. The bottle picked out was phenomenal and paired really well my entree.  I would recommend the sauteed mushrooms because everyone ordered a different side dish yet everyone ate my mushrooms so that should tell you something....\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Perfectly prepared red meat drowned in yummy sauce washed down with amazing wine.  Poppy couldn't ask for more.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] The food is outstanding. The service is amazing. The truffle chips are to die for. Their caesar salad is incomparable. Steak and shrimp is great as well.\n",
      "Cajun/Creole ['Steakhouses', 'Cajun/Creole', 'Restaurants'] Great meal, would be excellent but I had to send my steak back for a little more cooking (I said medium to well and it was more on the medium side - I am a bit picky with that).\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was perfect, however. Didn't have to wait long for anything, and I really like that the whole table is served at the same time, it's a nice subtle touch. Very attentive and friendly service.\n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoyed the experience and was not disappointed even going in with a high expectation.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Food', 'Coffee & Tea'] I have no complaints because I love using the app. Grab and Go, people. I don't like standing there ma thinking which treat I want that day. Use your app, choose, drive and get it. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is raining today so I had to just run in and out. I don't wait at all for this location. I even got the mango creme something when it was all out at other locations. \n",
      "\n",
      "There is a traffic light to go and out of this plaza. Easy to access via car, right on the Yonge stretch of road. There are outdoor seats, and some inside too.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Food', 'Coffee & Tea'] Always busy here. The line is never very long though so if you don't plan on staying, you can get in, get your beverage, and get out pretty fast. If you hope to get a table through, that may be hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plenty of parking all around as this store is part of a large plaza. \n",

      "WiFi works pretty well, particularly considering the number of guests with their laptops blazing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wish they'd stay open a bit longer. They close at 10 PM most days and there are always a bunch of guests surprised they are being kicked out.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Food', 'Coffee & Tea'] For Richmond HIll, I have found this to be pretty consistent.  Friendly staff and follow the drink instructions well.  Location is a bit small though.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Food', 'Coffee & Tea'] Great staff, super busy almost anytime of the day so be prepared to lineup.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Food', 'Coffee & Tea'] Dirty coffee mugs with coffee strains at the rim really turned me off!\n",
      "\n",
      "I have to give credit for the Starbucks for the placement of the electric outlets. There are really 3 different sets around the stores and spread out quite nicely. The chance of getting a table near a plug is quite good!\n",

      "The nice armchair in the front of the store is a great place to lounge and take a breather...\n",
      "\n",
      "But those coffee mugs!! Just gross me out!\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Food', 'Coffee & Tea'] You know, Starbucks gets a bit of a bad rap and I have to say that this particular Starbucks certainly does not deserve it. I was very excited when it opened just down the road from where I work. After all, the drive to coffee was pretty long. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here they do things right. The staff is knowledgable and friendly and they make good lattés. I'm not a fan of the fancy drinks. Just give me my espresso and steamed milk. Now, the thing about such sime tastes is that when a barista messes the drink up, there's nowhere to hide. There are only two ingredients after all. I have had some pretty nasty lattés in my time, but never from here. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, if you're far from the city and up in Oak Ridges, stop by this Starbucks for a lattè. I'm certain you will be perfectly happy...unless, of course, you don't like coffee.\n",
      "Fast Food ['Burgers', 'Fast Food', 'Restaurants'] Worse Mc Donald's I have ever visited. \n",
      "We ordered just French Fries on the automatic order board. \n",
      "They got the orders on that system totally screwed up. We waited over half an hour for just a French fries. Totally ridiculous. Our number was 414 they were serving according to the board number 220 but it does not go by order how high or low the numbers are. It jumps all over the place. \n",
      "No order or common sense what so ever. We should have ordered in the regular old fashion order line and not on the new boards. \n",
      "My fault. \n",
      "Don't ever have to come back again.\n",
      "Fast Food ['Burgers', 'Fast Food', 'Restaurants'] Same McDoonalds as everywhere. Cheap prices for non-healthy food but the service was UNBELIEVABLY slow. Not much room where to sit compared to other McDicks on top of it. The designer literally had no idea on how to take advantage of the room for a maximum of seating.\n",
      "Fast Food ['Burgers', 'Fast Food', 'Restaurants'] Little road trip to Montreal was amazing, after our last night there while hanging out with a friend, drivinv around landed us at a downtown McDonald's.\n",
      "\n",
      "By far the most disgusting dining room I've ever been to. Cold coffee, fruit and fiber muffin that was as hard as a brick. Might be almost as hard as Iron Man's body armor. I received a replacement muffin, but got a civics lesson on the coffee being cold because I ordered it with 2 milks. I'm sure she couldn't give an explanation for the bitter taste.\n",
      "Burgers ['Burgers', 'Fast Food', 'Restaurants'] McDonald's is McDonald's. This location was dead slow despite there being no one waiting for service. Cashier purposefully overcharged my friends because they were dunk. Horribly rude to do that.\n",
      "Burgers ['Burgers', 'Fast Food', 'Restaurants'] In the Village, right under the pink balls and next to 2 pokéstops. This McDo has everything to offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a tad small but given the location it's only justified.\n",
      "Burgers ['Burgers', 'Fast Food', 'Restaurants'] Quite possibly the most raunchy McDonald's on the planet. The staff is slow and the customers are sketchy. Avoid when possible.\n",
      "Fast Food ['Burgers', 'Fast Food', 'Restaurants'] A little disorganized, but I still got my food pretty fast.  It was tasty and although the place was very crowded, it was surprisingly clean.\n",
      "Fast Food ['Burgers', 'Fast Food', 'Restaurants'] This McDonald is really really and let me reiterate really show. The service is worse than what you see in the U.S. There's a long line and it takes forever to order you food, when you do order..heh have fun waiting. But honestly just by observing this mcdonalds, I'd say because it's understaffed. 3 people on the night shift?! The manager at this establishment needs to get his head together and hire more people to run this location.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] This is one of the more authentic Cantonese restaurants to be found in Edinburgh. As usual, there is a 'Chinese' menu and a 'Westerner's' menu, the latter catered a bit more to the Western palate. We had the salt and pepper squid (definitely a winner), the char siu (best I've had in Edinburgh), and a traditional seafood clay pot.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the curb appeal and the decor leaves passerby's unsure of the quality inside, the food is definitely worth sitting in for and enjoying! We will be back!!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Not eaten in so can't say much about the decor, the exterior had always put me off going in everything time I'd walked past. But it came highly recommended from a friend so decided to take the plunge and order some takeout.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ordered the set dinner for 2. Opting for spicy tofu in place of the beef with black bean. Everything was very tasty and nothing was over/under seasoned which is a pleasant change from some of the other takeout I've had! I believe they are also MSG free which is a major major bonus in my books!\n",

      "Considering it's now not far from my flat. I envisage getting food from here again and probably pretty soon!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Apart from the awesome name, Xanadu didn't bear well in my estimations. A group of friends from uni had visited the Chinese restaurant earlier last year and they weren't impressed with the food. However, when I got the chance to visit for a family members birthday meal, so I went with low expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The décor is very...blue! That's all I can really say! The tables and chairs were lovely and looked ornate, which made for an interesting talking point. The waiter was very nice, although he didn't really say much, I don't actually think he could speak much English to be honest. \n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to order one of the chef's specials from the menu, which are exclusive to Xanadu. I opted for the seafood nest combination, scallops, king prawns and squid in a Cantonese sauce, all wrapped in a delicious filo parcel which was outstanding. I absolutely love seafood and I am always a bit funny about ordering it in a Chinese restaurant, as I usually find it a bit undercooked for my tastes, but this seafood was cooked to absolute perfection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The house wine we ordered for the table was gorgeous too, and had a lovely sweet edge, which complimented my meal perfectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know what must have happened when my friends went that night, but I can honestly say Xanadu was one of the best Chinese meals I have ever had.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Hidden away in plain view on London Road (Dalziel Place), Xanadu really is worth a trip into part of Edinburgh not generally associated with restaurants. Cards on the tables display not only specials of the day but also a promise that no MSG is used. While dishes are standard Chinese UK restaurant fare, the freshness of the ingredients is evident and tasty. Favourites include Spare Ribs as a starter and Kung Po King Prawns or Crispy Shredded Beef as a main.\n",
      "\n",
      "Downsides are the slightly institutional feel of the decor and the classic pop hits on Chinese instruments piped muzak. An additional plus is the friendliness of the staff.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] This is a great Chinese take-away. I've never eaten in the restaurant, because I just live along the road, but don't let the somewhat cliched decor put you off. The food is delightful, fresh, filling and not stuffed with MSG. I love the crab and sweetcorn soup, the chilli and honey shredded chicken and the sweet and sour prawns.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Xanadu is the exotic name of a Chinese Restaurant n the bosom of the busy London Road in Edinburgh. It offers a warm and relaxing atmosphere adding to it a 30 years of cooking experience of the chef of the place. The restaurant has a special selection of Cantonese flavoured specialties of home cooked dishes - from the so popular Peking duck to Cowboy in honeymoon (shredded fillet of beef with peaches and sugar snap peas),Tropical chicken boat (chicken, mango and pineapple), and the savoury Lobster with ginger and spring onions, served with noodles. The range of seafood meals is also impressive,\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] I love this place. Any time my wife and I come to vegas we come here. I like the fresh chips with the 3 sides. The food is always good. Service is great. This is the old don miguels. I asked what had changed. Nothing only the name and owner. Staff and cooks are still the same. I like the quality of the food. i am very picky. I have never had a problem in this place.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] This is the worst excuse for Mexican food I have ever eaten, and I have eaten the southern cuisine at least twice a month for over 40 years. The food is obviously prepared weeks ahead of time and reheated to serve. The cheese  enchilada was so rubbery it was not edible. The beef enchilada was burned at both ends where it had been microwaved. Don't waste your calories, money or time with this place. Want cheap either!\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Not the best Mexican place, and not the worst.  Chips and Salsa to start off are great, with two sauces and beans to enjoy.  I wish they would change up the menu, as there are plenty of other choices they could serve to add some zing to this place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Staff is always friendly and service has always been good to us.  Food just needs an upgrade in my opinion.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Customer service is great. So 2 stars for service. \n",
      "Food is reheated and lousy. \n",
      "I will not come back.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] I was so surprised that our entrees were not very  good and the staff had an I don't care attitude, like we were bothering him.  Actually our waiter was borderline rude and it wasn't because they were busy because  there were only 2 tables with customers and this was at 8:15pm. I am really surprised that the Orleans allows this because I have been to every restaurant at the Orleans so many times and never received such bad service as well as bad food.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Very slow  service and poor wait staff. Worst Mexican food I've ever had. About on par for the Orleans.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Food was not good at all.  Chile rellano tasted chalky and chile was inedible.  My guy had an enchilada combo and said it tasted like a hungry man dinner. It was all very bland. Some of the worst Mexican food I've ever had. Service was good except that when the server asked if it was good, I told her it really wasn't and she ran away. Don't waste your money.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] My family and I had a reservation for dinner before our show. Our party of 6 was sat down at 6pm. The restaurant was only about half full. It took a full 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged our presence. The bus server who finally came by with chips and took our drink order didn't even get the drink order correct. She had to go back for my ice tea. It took another 15 minutes for the waitress to show up. Mind you, we flagged the manager down during this time and he said he would find our waitress and send her over. He didn't. He went back to his stand, completely ignoring our request. After another 15 minutes we did finally get our food...I had the flautas. All I can figure is my order was done first and just sat waiting for everyone elses. It was luke warm and soggy, same thing happened to two other diners in our party as well on completely different dishes. We talked with the Manager again on our way out and he truly didn't care. If you love crappy food and seriously lousy service, go ahead and go there. My family and I sure won't.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] The food was only so so.  The shredded beef tacos and pork enchiladas were on the bland side and the rice was very dry and tasteless. The dips that came with the chips were good and the margaritas were pretty good for the price.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] The big special is two items for $7.99.  That is a discount over the regular $12.00.  That would be fine but the deal is not that great.  2 tacos for $7.99 is just ok.  The problem is that our server was so mean and nasty about making us all pull out a players card to get the deal before she even served any drinks.  She looked out the top of her glasses at us and acted like the special was much better than it is.  Most places ask to see one card per couple, including the buffet which offers good discounts for players card holders.  But this lady demanded my mother and father, who were tired on their trip, each go through their items and pull out a card each and acted like a cop rather than a food server.\n",
      "The chips and salsas they served were adequate and we each had a drink before we decided we were not willing to be abused by this mean spirited server any longer and we did not order the 2 item special in spite of the server insisting it was such a good deal.  We got a better deal down the way at TGIF for better food and they did not act like we were criminals.  Never going back here again.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Located in the Orleans Hotel Casino, this is a Mexican restaurant that is pretty laid back not the festive craziness of Senor Frogs. The prices are very good and the food is not bad either. Is it worth a special trip, no. But if you are in the neighborhood, you could certainly do worse, at very least you can get a great Margarita. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Very bland, genetic food. Nothing offensive on the menu but nothing spectacular either.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Whenever I eat here I really want to love this place.  The chips & assorted salsas/dips you start with are SO great.  And then I get my entree.  And then I'm just left feeling mediocre about this place.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's good: The aforementioned chips & salsa. $3 house margaritas (WHA?!? Yes Please).  Most sauces are good.  Food seems pretty fresh.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's OK: Service. The actual food - it pretty much all tastes the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing's bad...it just is a place to eat some OK Mexican food when you want a break from losing your money at the tables.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Reading all these reviews I'm totally confused by all these negative reviews. I'm wondering if they've changed management since the reviews we're all old & our experience was so positive. Went last night & ordered the carne asada & I can't stop thinking about the deliciousness. It was literally magic. The flavors & quality of meat were amazing. Did someone tell the cook we were VIP's?!?? ;-) I Emphatically recommend the carne asada. Hubs got the carnitas and they were really good too. I'd be happy with that order but the CARNE ASADA....!!!!!   Wonder if I can talk Hubs into going again night....\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Im giving this place one star based on the food and customer service. Our server was crabby as hell and my food was disgusting. I ordered a chimichanga and it wasnt even fried it was like a burrito with disgusting pot roast in the middle. To make.matters even worse my son ordered taquitos and one fell off the plate and the server picked it up with her hands and.placed it back on the plate. I wasnt gonna let him eat it after that. All around disgusted with my experience here.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] The fajita special for 2 was a great value.  Margaritas are tasty, but the fajitas were somewhat bland. Dessert was fried banana or ice cream which were both very good\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] While on this side of town taking care of some errands, I suggested this place to hubby since we were passing by it anyway. I have eaten here many times in the past but it had been a while so I was curious to see what had changed if anything. \n",
      "\n",
      "They now have a \"Coasta Cantina Express\" which is right where you walk in to be seated in the actual restaurant. If you don't want to eat inside this gives you the option to just grab it to-go. I would think you could just order it to-go from inside the restaurant the same but maybe people don't think about that and having the express makes them realize that they want a taco. The express menu is limited compared to the menu inside but has the standard favorites. You can choose tacos, burritos, salads, rice bowls, quesadillas, nachos, soda, water and it wouldn't be Vegas unless they sold beer and they do that too. $4 a beer! Eating inside gets you free chips, salsa & bean dip but if you want it from the express it is going to cost you $3.50 (no beans just chips & salsa) and $1.95 if you want to add rice and beans to your order. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now that I was finished being nosy about the express option I decided eating inside would be better for us. We were seated right away and had our drink orders taken. The person bringing us refills was spot on he was quick to refill our chips & salsa or ask if we needed anything but our server lacked a lot of things. It took her 15 minutes for her to even come over and see us and then 5 more minutes until she came back to take our order. We finished 2 rounds of chips & salsa before she came over to us. They weren't very busy at all so I don't know what the deal was. The chips & salsa are good and the bean dip is amazing. It tasted just like I remembered it. When it came to the main course I ordered the \"Cheese Enchiladas\" made with flour tortillas. It came with a side of beans (I know I said it but the beans are so tasty!) and rice. It wasn't terrible at all but it wasn't spectacular. I think it could be due to the fact that the plate wasn't very warm when it arrived. I was able to get it for $7.99 after I showed my players card. Currently if you have a players card then on weekdays before 6 pm you can get a 2 item combo for just $7.99. My meal would have been $11 with out the deal. Score! Hubby ordered a \"Shredded Beef Burrito\" priced at $12 and had it smothered for 99 cents more. He enjoyed it and found the size to be good but again the food was sorta cold. \n",
      "\n",
      "This could have been easily given more stars by me if the server did her job and if the food wasn't on the cold side. I will more then likely leave this location to the tourists and stick to the location closer to my home.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] I would give them a zero if I could based strictly on the customer service quality. We were a group of six who went in with a BOGO coupon created by Coasta Cantina expressly for our convention at the nearby Orleans Arena.  After a lot of needless debate (the coupon was really straightforward, but he tried to make it sound ambiguous), the manager refused to honor the coupon. He also didn't want to push two tables together to allow us to be more comfortable, and opted instead to have 6 of us sit at a small round table. Weird, but we complied with that. This was at 9 PM on a weeknight, so the place was pretty much empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are too many details to include them all in this review, so I'll just sum up with this feedback for management/owners:  own your mistake while we are still at the table, and not after we've already walked out the door. Seat us where we are most comfortable, and not what's most convenient for you (especially when the restaurant is practically empty).\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] My wife and myself have been eating here for many years. The food is good and the servers are always attentive.. Our meals (2/7/15) were tasty and enjoyable. I ordered Chicken El Cortez (14) and my wife had Chicken Azteca (14). The meals had two large chicken breasts on each of our plates which left us stuffed ( one would have sufficed). You get complimentary chips and salsa along with a small cup of Fideo soup.. On holidays and special events it does get busy. But that's the same with all casino restaurants, This one is located in the Orleans. There are lots of Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas but trying to find a good one to suit your taste buds is challenging. Having some ability to speak in Spanish is a plus for you local establishments lets face it. This is a good choice for a nice meal at reasonable prices.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Try the ceviche and find heaven on earth! I was bummed when I found out Don Miguel's was now called Coasta Cantina but the menu is pretty much the same and all I cared about was that they still had my favorite ceviche. Yum yum!\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Yuck,\n",
      "In a town with a huge Latino population, why can't the food be just a little bit better?  The only good part of the meal was the chips and salsa.  Don't get the flavored margaritas because mine tasted like mango syrup on the rocks.  Stick to the traditional or just order a beer.  Flavorless and lukewarm food.  Get out of this casino if you want food, I have eaten at the Oyster Bar, Coffee Shop and now here and for some reason the food in all three restaurants is undesirable and barely heated through.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Coasta Cantina is the new name for the restaurant Don Miguel's.  You still get the three types of dip with the chips, menu seems to be the same, and the specials seem to be the same.  I had the carnitas, and it was okay; the pork could have used more flavor, but it was okay.  It's just your typical corporate owned Mexican Restaurant, nothing more, nothing less.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] This was the first (and last) time we had eaten at this restaurant. We were at The Orleans and thought we would try it out (since TGI Fridays had a long wait). The waitress, Oralia, was very nice and got our drinks right away. The chips and salsa were nothing special. We did have to ask several times to get refills on our soda. When our food came out  all 3 of our orders were wrong. Finally after getting everything correct the food was not that great. When the bill came we saw they had charged us for a side of cheese (which we did ask for but they didn't tell us there was a charge for it) and they charged us for an item that ended up being sent back because it was wrong. We finally got the bill sorted out and went to pay the waitress, using credit cards and cash, and that became another ordeal I won't go into. Bottom line: DON'T EAT HERE!!!\n",

      "French ['French', 'Restaurants', 'German'] Mit Gästen aus Mexiko abends in den Hirschen gegangen, weil es nebenan im Schnitzbiegel überfüllt war. Das Ambiente gefällt mir, und beim letzten Besuch war auch die Bedienung sehr nett. Diesmal fand ich diese leider wieder unprofessionell. Die Weinkarte ist auswendig gelernt, aber genauere Nachfragen zu Winzer, Jahrgang, Herkunft darf man nicht stellen. Da muss man schon selber das Etikett lesen. Geht gar nicht. Und wenn die Speisen gebracht und erklärt werden, möchte ich nicht, dass man mit den Fingern in meinem Essen herumzeigt. Auch diese Texte sind auswendig gelernt, die Bedienung macht nicht den Eindruck, dass sie wirklich weiß, was sie da erklärt.\n",
      " \n",
      "Zu den Speisen kann ich nur meine eigenen beurteilen. Das Zanderfilet war von hervorragender Qualität, auf den Punkt gegart und schmackhaft. Es war auf einem Gemüsegelee platziert. Dann kam die Bedienung und goss eine Gemüsebouillon drüber. Danach thronte der Fisch auf seinem Gelee, aber von der Brühe bekam er nichts ab, es sei denn, man tunkte ihn hinein. Dafür löste sich bei jedem Gabelstich der grüne Gelee in der Brühe auf, was nicht sehr schmackhaft aussah.\n",
      " \n",
      "Die sehr fein und mit leckerem Gemüseklein zubereiteten Bratkartoffeln als Beilage kamen in einer Art Saucière. Man hatte die Wahl: entweder die schön knackigen Kartoffeln in die Brühe kippen und matschig werden lassen, oder die Kartoffeln direkt aus der Saucière essen!?! Da mir der Geschmack wichtiger war als der feine Anstand, entschied ich mich für die zweite Variante, kam mir aber komisch vor.\n",
      " \n",
      "Zweierlei Ziegenkäse zum Nachtisch: die warme Variante war gut und lecker, aber auch keine große Kunst. Die geeiste Ziegenkäsecreme muss irgendwie modifiziert werden, denn sie beginnt schon nach wenigen Sekunden zu schmelzen. Man kann also nur Matsche zusammenschieben und versuchen, diese auf den Löffel zu bekommen. Oder man muss das Eis sofort und möglichst schnell zuerst essen und den Rest später.\n",
      "German ['French', 'Restaurants', 'German'] Gehobene Küche mit guten Weinen in schönen Ambiente und freundlichem Service. Dies ist abgekürzt die Essenz eines Besuches in diesem Restaurant. Die Vorspeisen und Hauptspeisen waren allesamt raffiniert und gekonnt zubereitet, die Portionsgrößen passend. Die Weinbegleitung war stimmig und die Bedienung half bei allen Fragen prompt weiter. Auch das Hotel (v.a. der Neubau) ist sehr modern und chic eingerichtet. Allenfalls moderner Irrsinn wie eine Glaswand zur Toilette erschließen sich einem bislang eher in Einsamkeit der Defäkation fröhnenden Gast weder auf den Ersten noch zweiten Blick. Es hat einfach keinen Sinn. Der Gastgeber und Inhaber ist übrigens mit Herzblut dabei uns erzählt gerne und enthusiatisch von seinem Bestreben etwas mehr Genuss in diese Welt zu bringen - und dies mit Erfolg!\n",

I had the veggie lasagna and it was fabulous! The flavor was full and rich. I would visit this place again if in town.\n",
      "Pizza ['Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Wine Bars', 'American (New)', 'Pizza'] Well, we got invited to join our friend for an after work libation.  Goodness, would never have found this gem otherwise.  What a wonderful place. Good selection of draft craft beers, great service, and very comfortable setting. Can't wait to come back.\n",
      "Pizza ['Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Wine Bars', 'American (New)', 'Pizza'] Stopped by for some cocktails before going to First Friday at the Heard (directly across on Central).  Had the roasted vegatable which lacked flavor and did not have any significant roasted goodness.  On the plus side even though it was hopping on a Friday after work, they were able to get us a seat at the bar within ~5 minutes.\n",
      "Pizza ['Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Wine Bars', 'American (New)', 'Pizza'] Went here for wine, didn't order any food but I loved the place.

      "Pizza ['Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Wine Bars', 'American (New)', 'Pizza'] I live nearby and this place is a true blessing to the neighborhood.  Delicious food.

Quirky location, old restored house. Best for small groups 2-4. Staff laid back and friendly. Menu looks promising. Wine tastes great, bartender was helpful and knowledgeable about wine choices. good easy music, not so loud you can't visit. Came early hours, 3ish- so can't speak to wait time or ease of getting seat during later hours.  Happy Hour from 11-6, nice. Wish it was in my neighborhood.  Most of the seating are bar stools, a few tables with chairs. Respectable beer list. I will return.\n",

      "Pizza ['Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Wine Bars', 'American (New)', 'Pizza'] I just had a couple glasses of wine here but I was impressed with the service. I like the ambiance a lot. Quaint little place that I'd like to return to. It was perfect for our girls night, it was charming and quiet enough to be able to enjoy great conversation. They had corn-hole and patio furniture to relax in. I can't comment on the food, but I will be returning to check it out.\n",
      "Pizza ['Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Wine Bars', 'American (New)', 'Pizza'] First time visiting this place after hearing about it for months. For ambiance, I would give this 5 stars. It's small, intimate and has a downtown charm to it. I would add that it's self-seating and we arrived at 7pm on a Friday night. We got a table right away but it was at the bar where my wife and I were outside and our 2 friends were across from us but inside. Still kinda fun!\n",
      "\n",
      "The food was perfect. We built a meat and cheese board and they have great options, very comparable to Postino, if not better. We also ordered the Italian combo flatbread which was perfect. Their wine list is better than Postino and I had the Malbec. For dessert, my wife had the gelato with dulce flavoring and it was divine. I ordered the tiramisu. They only had one slice left (this was around 8:30pm on a Friday night so slightly disappointing). I share that because my friend's husband wanted one too. We ended up sharing it and our server added a candle after we all joked about the two of us sharing an intimate slice of tiramisu. \n",
      "\n",
      "This will be a regular spot for ushering forward. It is better than Postino (with way better parking too) but not as close to us. But very worth the drive. We didn't even play corn hole but it was readily available!\n",
      "Pizza ['Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Wine Bars', 'American (New)', 'Pizza'] Very, very good! Staff is friendly, & the atmosphere is intimate & accommodating. Chocolate torte with gelato is unreal! Great flat breads!\n",

      "\n",
      "We had the braised beef and the Italian flatbread, and we then finished the meal off with some imported tiramisu. The beef was marinated in a light tomato stew for several hours and was incredibly tender. Fingerling potatoes accompanied the beef and were expertly roasted. The bread (including the flatbread) was fresh and delicious; it is homemade and, as a plus, completely vegan. In fact, everything tasted like it had been made that day. \n",
      "\n",
      "The tiramisu, although imported from Italy, was carefully selected by the restaurant and the best I had ever had. Important to note: the tiramisu was HUGE- definitely a shareable dessert if you have more than one person!\n",
      "\n",
      "Of exceptional note was the service. Finding great customer service is important to me, and unfortunately, it seems hard to come by these days. Not at Oven and Vine. Our waiter, Ronnie, made us feel like we were longtime friends of the restaurant. In choosing a bottle of wine, he brought us out some generous tastings to help us in making a decision. It was clear that he took great pride in the restaurant. The Pinot noir (Sharecropper's) we settled on was great!   All in all, Ronnie's enthusiasm was infectious and made the experience that much better. :) \n",
      "\n",
      "On a final note, the building is architecturally cool and close to rollover donuts, which is also an awesome place. Oven and Vine was working on developing the outside area, and I look forward to seeing how that turns out. There are some games and places to sit and enjoy wine. \n",

We tried the olive and soppresata flatbread. The chicken green chile was spicy and delicious with a side of roasted veggies served with fresh bread. Roasted veggies had string beans beets roasted garlic and onion. It was super tasty. We also tried the au gratin potatoes which was freshly made and sliced with care. \n",

      "Pizza ['Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Wine Bars', 'American (New)', 'Pizza'] Took foodie friends here. (They ran their own place in NM and make great homemade pizza.) The verdict is this place is a keeper. House white was superior. The flatbread had an intriguing crust with quality toppings; the salad was of quality ingredients; the vegetable rigatoni was worth coming back for; the braised beef was tender and tasty; we had a second order of fresh baked bread; but the potatoes stole the show. Candidate for Best Ever, reminiscent of Rosti. The whole experience was notably Continental.\n",

Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and was able to recommend wine and beer that really suited our tastes. Further, the pizza we ordered: margarita and the second was a sausage pizza were both delicious. Simple yet flavorful ingredients. Will certainly return in cooler months to enjoy the games on the patio with a glass of wine!\n",
      "Pizza ['Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Wine Bars', 'American (New)', 'Pizza'] The atmosphere is relaxed. The parking lot matches the seating. The food is good. I wish there were a few more options, but that's okay. Overall, I would love to eat there again.\n",
      "Pizza ['Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Wine Bars', 'American (New)', 'Pizza'] Amazing place. The outdoor area is my favorite. Cool and hip, lots of outdoor sitting plus you can take your dog with you! There is a small lawn/game area and the entire place is just lovely. Service is good, the owner actually serves us on many nights. Great flatbreads (pizzas), good sandwiches and great pasta! Plus they have lots of beers on tap. Perfect!\n",
      "Pizza ['Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Wine Bars', 'American (New)', 'Pizza'] A really nice solid American restaurant.  I had the baked rigatoni with sausage--it really hit the spot.  The bread that accompanied the meal was amazing.  The atmosphere was really nice and my server was attentive.  Overall, a great restaurant for the neighborhood and worth a stop by if you're in the area.\n",
      "Pizza ['Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Wine Bars', 'American (New)', 'Pizza'] This is a great little place to chill with friends.  We had the burrata and potato gratin appetizer (so yummy) and a variety of the flatbreads. The pesto flatbread was phenomenal.  Our waiter was attentive and kind and made some good recommendations on the beer and wine. Would definitely come back again.\n",
      "Pizza ['Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Wine Bars', 'American (New)', 'Pizza'] Great spot! Very unique, a ton of beer on tap. Food was phenomenal, a must.  Service was great, very helpful and friendly.\n",
      "Pizza ['Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Wine Bars', 'American (New)', 'Pizza'] It was pretty good.  I really liked the restored old house and the cool vibe.  They had a patio and \"backyard\" with cornhole that looked like it would be a lot of fun...when its not 108 degrees outside at lunchtime.  The menu was a little limited. Lots of flatbread options but limited options beyond flatbread - a couple salads and a couple other dishes.  Some more non-flatbread options would be my only suggestion.  Other than that, its a really nice, casual, local, non-chain lunch and drinks option.\n",
      "Pizza ['Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Wine Bars', 'American (New)', 'Pizza'] Such a fun place!  We had great service and the kids loved the lawn games.  Pasta was not great but everything else was top notch.\n",
      "Pizza ['Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Wine Bars', 'American (New)', 'Pizza'] Very charming place, our server was friendly and didn't rush us as we were taking a lil bit of time deciding what to order. We ordered the cheese plate, pork with green chili and ravioli. Pasta was just ok but pork chili was very good and great wine and cheese selections.\n",
      "Pizza ['Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Wine Bars', 'American (New)', 'Pizza'] I have been contemplating posting this since last night but I have to do it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Brought a friend in last night since I have been raving about it.  Ordered my usual margherita pizza with spinach but opted for extra mozzarella cheese since they put so little on normally (I know that's how its supposed to be tho).  Pizza came and it was obvious from first look that the cheese was not the normal fresh mozzarella they use.  There were a few chunks of fresh mozzarella but mostly a yellowish grated cheese.  I tried a few bites and it tasted like the cheap crappy cheese.  I asked the waiter about it and he denied it and said it was all fresh mozzarella.  I couldn't eat the cheese and ended up taking the cheese off and ate just the crust and sauce.   \n",
      "\n",
      "The waiter came back a bit later and said he talked to the cook and confirmed it was fresh mozzarella and tried to blame it on the fact we had Burratta as an appetizer so the fresh mozzarella must taste bad compared to the Burratta since Burratta is such a top quality cheese.  I can't believe he said that but I dropped it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I love the vibe of this place and every other time everything I've had rocked.  I will try it again but it it's crap cheese again I am done.  \n",
      "\n",
      "By the way... the Burratta I mentioned earlier was an accidental delivery.  We ordered the plain bread to start with and when he brought the plate it had Burratta on it and said he mistakenly put it in wrong and asked if we would eat it.  I said sure since they would have thrown it out otherwise.  I still got charged for it tho.  That's kinda shitty in my opinion.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I really hope this place isn't going downhill or cheaping out.  I hope it was just a bad night but I had to post it in case someone else has the same issue.\n",
      "Pizza ['Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Wine Bars', 'American (New)', 'Pizza'] Oven and Vine was awesome! A great experience from the start to the finish. I knew that Dylan and Michelle had opened a new restaurant (they used to have Portlands, a place that I dearly loved) but I was not sure where it was located. I was so excited when some friends of mine took me to Oven and Vine this week and it was their new place.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the green chili pork, it was amazing!! Our server was very attentive, friendly and prompt. Food was not only great, but hot and attractive presentation. I will most definately be returning to Oven and Vine!\n",
      "Pizza ['Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Wine Bars', 'American (New)', 'Pizza'] Well thought out beer selection. The \"Italian Combo\" flatbread pizza I had was VERY nice. Met the young lady that owns the place, and she's a sweetheart. Super relaxed atmosphere. I'd be eating here regularly if I lived nearby.\n",

      "Pizza ['Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Wine Bars', 'American (New)', 'Pizza'] So, after watching South Park this week, I feel oddly \"dirty\" writing a review...especially my first...but I digress...Amazing brunch...eggs on the flatbread or in the green chili and the French toast (without the egg on top naturally)?!?  If only it were Sunday brunch every day...seriously though, the staff is great (they can make or break a meal) and so is the food.  And dinner?  I usually have a favorite meal at a restaurant and I become a creature of habit ordering the same thing over and over...but I actually rotate through the different meals here - you can't go wrong.  And the beer and wine selection is great too. Don't go with a big group - just a couple of close friends or family and enjoy...\n",
      "Pizza ['Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Wine Bars', 'American (New)', 'Pizza'] Charming little place tucked away in dwntn Phx. Stopped there for lunch and had the best green chili chicken ever! It is packed with chicken and rich with flavor and complimented with just the right amount of heat. If you like your green chili w/ heat, then you'll want to add this to your list of places to try. Oh and the potato au gratin is sinfully delicious. I will be back there to try other dishes....and the green chili chicken....again.\n",
      "Pizza ['Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Wine Bars', 'American (New)', 'Pizza'] Yum, yum, yum!! This is such a great little spot, plus it's walking distance from my house (incentive to drink more wine I think)! These guys know what they are doing and I am so happy to see the owners have more success after Portlands closed. \n",
      "\n",
      "The menu has a nice selection of options, with flat breads taking up a good chunk of it. I've had many of them, most recently The Earl. Dang, that was one spicy flat bread but totally delicious. Their Ashland salad is quite yummy (you can't go wrong with bacon) and I also really like to get their roasted veggies too. The burrata is also delicious, I just wish there was more it to devour. I've also heard good things about the lasagna and green chile pork. \n",
      "\n",
      "They also have a nice selection of wines and beers with the waiters all being pretty knowledgeable in guiding you to a good glass. The food is always out quick, servers always friendly, plus the decor is just adorable. I love the bathrooms (weird to say but check them out and you'll agree :D).\n",
      "Fast Food ['Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Fast Food'] I really like that Qdoba made the pick 2 menu...I always love a good quesadilla but I like their naked burrito too. Now I get to have both! I also like that the pick 2 options are smaller so it's a little bit better portion control vs a huge burrito. \n",
      "Qdoba is the same principle as other Mexican fast food such as Zaba's or  Chipolate.  Everything is made to order right in front of you.  Quick service.  Decent prices. Get the Qdoba Qcard when you go here.  You'll get a free meal after X-number of purchases. (I can't remember if they base it off of points or number of meals purchases...either way it's a good deal!)\n",
      "The chips and queso and/or guacamole are always a good addition to a meal!\n",
      "I used to go there when I lived in South Dakota.  I frequented it when I lived in Carson City.  And I still go to Qdoba in Las Vegas!\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Fast Food'] Delicious, fresh, filling. Multiple visits and no issues. Always good food, always so happy and full. Prefer them over Chipotle. Gotta get that queso!\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Fast Food'] My review is solely based on the nachos which are the bomb diggity bomb. This place is exactly as my bestie described it. Sort of like Chipotle, but better, much better. \n",
      "\n",
      "The few times I've had the nachos they were just great. I have tried the shredded beef, the pulled pork and the lime chicken which were all in my opinion properly seasoned and fresh. So were all the toppings. All of the toppings are great, yes ALL of them. Yes, I have tried them all. Nope, no shame. The spicy cheese is to die for, ask them to spread it all over erryting!\n",
      "\n",
      "It really boils down to taste. If you're open minded like me... stop in, and try it, try it all. Not all at once, but little by little until you hit your sweet spot. The customer service is great. They greet customers the second they walk in thru the doors.  I've always taken my orders to go. The place looks very clean and organized. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tip: If you are a beer lover like me, get yourself some cold ice beers before you go grab yourself some nachos, you're welcome.\n",
      "Fast Food ['Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Fast Food'] Our first time here. The two staff were very helpful. We are on weightwatchers and were able to pick and choose what we wanted to eat. All the meats were lean. It was great and tasted very good. We will be going back.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Fast Food'] Good fresh and fast Mexican food. Trendy vibe. Had the three tacos and it was very filling. My teen had the pulled beef grilled quesadilla and it was also very filling. Not far off the 215/n Stephanie so it's an easy stop on the way to/from airport and a lot better than the regular fast food fare.\n",
      "Fast Food ['Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Fast Food'] My fiancée and I love this place! The staff is very generous and the girl that works nights is always extra friendly!\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Fast Food'] Delicious and I think they give you a lot of bang for your buck! The concept of this place is like chipotle but I feel like they give you a bit more food. I like that you can choose between a burrito, bowl or nachos and you can build up upon it.\n",
      "\n",
      "After my workout before a softball game, I was STARVINGGGG so I wanted something clean but filling and we happened to drive by and it only made sense since everything else was greasy fried food. I got the bowl with white rice, tequila lime chicken, all the veggies, pinto beans and no sauce and it totally hit the spot for $7.80. Not a bad price at all and they loaded up my bowl with food.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like if you're on a budget, eating here would be a good choice as the bowls and burritos are good for 2 meals or 2 people. Definitely fresh food, the chicken was nice and juicy and the veggies were nice and crisp. \n",
      "\n",
      "Staff were very kind and got the food out quickly and efficiently. All in all, I will be coming back to this restaurant when I'm on this side of town!\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Fast Food'] Not super awesome. My wife's sour cream tasted like old cheese and her quesadilla had some sort of protoplasm in it.  Super not cool\n",
      "Fast Food ['Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Fast Food'] I love this place as I'm a fan of mexican grills and this place easily contends with Chipotle and Zaba's. The meat is very good and my favorite aspect of the resteraunt is the various choices to pack your bowl. Chipotle, though very good, has barely any toppings for your bowls/burritos. You can be very creative with your bowls at Qdoba- and GUAC IS NOT EXTRA! It's a tad pricey, a steak bowl/burrito and a large drink coming above $10. If you get a Qdoba member card, you rack up points and get a free bowl after 10 purchases. Carlos always helps me and he's a very chill guy who's generous with the scoops of meat- unlike Chipotle. I go here very often and it surprises me that the lines aren't as long as other mexican grills.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Fast Food'] I love the food and everything about this place. Great food and great customer service. The food has good taste and flavorful. The burrito is hugh and the staff are nice. The atmosphere is good and a very clean place to eat. I would go back...and I have.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Fast Food'] I really had no clue what type of concept Qdoba was because I had never heard of it at all, this location is right by our house and we gave it try since our first time but it will be our last..\n",
      "\n",
      "This place is barely OK, just in the same lines as Chipotle :/\n",
      "\n",
      "My mom ordered a ground beef taco and a beef and bean burrito as was not thrilled at all. Neither was I, how can you mess up at plain basic soft taco? Their meat doesn't taste good, it's not seasoned and didn't taste fresh. I only got a soft taco with meat and cheese and it was like $3.00+!\n",
      "\n",
      "Rice and beans are just so so, the best things were their chips and queso dip, that was the only redemption in this meal. If you like Chipotle than you will like this place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Staff was friendly and accommodating to us since it was our first time! I hope the food quality improve :/\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Fast Food'] Delicious !\n",
      "The Quesadilla, 3- knock out tacos we had were very good. Food is not greasy and full of flavor. We also tried chips with Queso Diablo yum! It was a bit spicy as it has chunks of jalapeño.\n",
      "If u are around try it.\n",
      "Next to the Henderson DMV after being there for 2 hours this meal was worth it ;)\n",
      "Fast Food ['Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Fast Food'] This is a great place !! Clean, warm, beautiful. Burritos are just awsome, tacos are delicious \n",
      "5 stars cuz you get good food and prices are fair\n",
      "Fast Food ['Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Fast Food'] If not for the Buy 1, Get 1 coupon I get from the e-mail club, \n",
      "I'd not come here at all. I've had quite a few different menu items, and the carnitas bowl (Mexican gumbo) is very good. My food usually tastes pretty fresh, and the portions are pretty big. Service is usually just so-so, but speaks volumes when there are 10 other Mexican places nearby.\n",
      "Fast Food ['Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Fast Food'] The food is 4 star, service is 3 star. But you don't exactly go to a Qdoba for the service. The food is good, fresh tasting and every entree comes with free guacamole!\n",
      "\n",
      "We like this place because if you're on the Qdoba mailing list you get BOGOs occasionally.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I would recommend this place if you like chipole or similar type joints. It's classic Americanized Mexican food. \n",
      "\n",
      "I like the plain veggie bowls and tacos best. The chicken is mediocre and the steak a short step up from that.\n",
      "Fast Food ['Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Fast Food'] I go between 3 and 4 stars for Qdoba.  Sometimes service is great; sometimes it stinks.  Sometimes the food is great; sometimes it stinks.  Sensing a theme here?  \n",
      "\n",
      "If I leave this place alone for a while and come back I enjoy it immensely.  The food is good and fresh, albeit not authentic.  And sometimes you just crave this sort of thing.  I admit that when I'm in the mood for something like this I like Qdoba more than Chipotle.  On my last visit the service was quick and on point and the chicken tacos and three cheese queso hit the spot.  I think I'll give it some time before my next visit so I'll like it just as much!\n",
      "Fast Food ['Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Fast Food'] Love the food!  Unfortunately, some of the staff at this location makes your food better then others!\n",
      "Fast Food ['Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Fast Food'] I wish I'd gotten the chance to try the food. I walked in today at around 5 pm and I see the manager standing in the kitchen eating. When he saw me he turned around & put some gloves on. Already two health code violations in this visit: he was eating in the kitchen and didn't wash his hands before helping me. While I stared at the menu for a minute, he scooped some rice into a container and put it aside. I guess I took too long to decide because he huffed out, \"Let me know when you're ready\", grabbed the rice, and continued to eat. I turned to tell my fiance I didn't want to eat there anymore because of how rude this guy was and we walked out. A couple minutes later I went in again and asked the other guy behind the counter for his manager's name. When he said \"Danny\" the manager, who was helping other customers, turned and saw me. I told Danny that I live across the street & would never come back because of his attitude, to which he responded \"What attitude?\", WITH that same rude attitude. No apology, no attempt to explain himself, no attempt to keep a potential regular. So no business from me.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Fast Food'] Q doba has no limits!  Get as much as you want!  Chipotle doesn't carry any queso sauces of any kind.   Chipotle charges you for guacamole.  You get all the guacamole, FREE at Q doba!  At Chipotle, they give you the standard coke selection, at Q doba, more than 100 kinds of drinks!  There's no ecoli, and no stores closing, like Chipotle.  If you want to trust Chipotle, I wish you luck.  I get better service, more food, free guacamole, 20x the choice of drinks, and no ecoli at Qdoba!  Q doba ROCKS!  I was there for lunch yesterday, and it was perfect as always.  I live at Cornado and Eastern, where there is a chipotle a few hundred yards from my apartment.  I would rather drive to Q doba where they appreciate my business.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Fast Food'] I love quick burrito places, and Chipotle tends to top the list.  But Qdoba comes a close second for one reason: Queso Sauce!  It's spicy and goes great in burritos or on nachos.  No other place carries it good as here.  I know, I know ... calorie killer!  But killer taste, man.  Sign up for their Qdoba card and you get a free Welcome Chips and Salsa, then every tenth burrito is free.  They email me $5 entree & drink combo coupons all the time, sometimes even Buy One Get One and I get to treat my coworker to free lunch.  The staff has always been nice, and I like that they're open late (10pm).\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Fast Food'] Food is great but the staff needs to be as good as the food and speak English!\n",
      " So this the  only place where their meat is well done, it  seems the other joints that are similar to this place,  the steak is not as well done. So if you like well done meat it's good. Beware of staff\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Fast Food'] Would give it 10 stars if I could! Every time I'm hangry I come here. Chicken queso burrito. \n",
      "\n",
      "I love how they always greet you when you come in. Fast food but not fast food. The new tacos are just alright. I like the yard bird but some of the others are too complex with different flavors.\n",
      "Fast Food ['Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Fast Food'] Even worse service than normal today. My burrito was all fixed up, and then I waited and waited for someone to ring me up. Then there was a mixup that took three workers to solve. It shouldn't have been difficult. When I was finally finished getting rung up, the woman who was at the cash register, instead of handing me my receipt, held on to it while she turned her attention to the mixup at her side. \n",
      "\n",
      "This Qdoba has consistently had really terrible service, and I'm not gonna go here anymore.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Fast Food'] I prefer Qdoba over some similar places such as Chipotle mostly because Qdoba has more selections to choose from and because I am a hige fan of the Queso cheese.  Other than that this place isn't anything too special.  The food is pretty good, the prices are 'ok', and the place is clean which is about all you can ask; however these types of places are a dime a dozen and I can find better quality foods at Carlito's Burritos or places like that.  One thing that I do love and would recommend to anyone is order the Chicken or steak quesadilla and order a side of chips and queso.  They give you way more queso than you need for the chips, so take the Chicken quesadilla and dip it in the queso cheese for an amazing taste.  Also, sign up for the Qdoba fan club and you will get a $6 meal deal coupon about once a month which is a nice little deal to have.\n",
      "Fast Food ['Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Fast Food'] This place used to be good.  I hadn't been there since earlier this year.  Their lime rice used to be delicious and they even had grilled veggies which I would get on my naked burrito.  Yesterday, when my husband went to get the order which consisted of a veggie and a chicken naked burrito, he said that there was nothing in the pans and that in his words, \"They were scraping the bottom of the pans\" putting the food in our order.   He ordered the chicken and got almost no chicken in there.  They looked at my husband like he was crazy when he asked for the grilled veggies for my order.  When he brought the food home, I noticed immediately, the rice didn't taste the same and there were no grilled veggies.  They had filled it up with a lot of lettuce and very little of anything else, which was like a big salad.  What a waste of money!  The quality and taste has definitely changed, and we won't be going back.\n",
      "Fast Food ['Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Fast Food'] I love Qdoba. We get the Craft 2 and chips and queso and 2 drinks with free refills for around $20,bucks and it's more than enough for a quick meal. The Craft 2 gives you 2 tacos and choice of another item so we get the quesidilla. Yummy.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Fast Food'] After a busy morning of moving I thought I would take in the Qdoba after having passed it numerous times in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "The set up is much the same as a Zaba's or a Chipolte as is the chow.  I ordered up a Queso Burrito with chicken and a side of chips w/ queso sauce.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found the food in general to be a bit bland which I determined to be a result of the much touted three cheese queso sauce.  I flavored it up with some bottled hot sauce.\n",

      "Not hating, not loving but just plain OK.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food'] Average Costa location. Not the best, but not the worst. \n",

      "So I've been stopping at this Costa for tea for a week now due to my temporary housing arrangement nearby on Waterloo. The service is fine. My tea is ready quickly and the cashier is always friendly to me. \n",
      "\n",
      "The seating inside is facing Princes Mall. Yes, your indoor seating faces a mall. So with all of the beautiful things to see nearby, you are looking at a staircase to the mall and a few stores. The seating arrangement outside also leaves much to be desired. Again, no real view of anything. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of the service, it's average. They get your order out pretty quickly but often don't say much when you get your order. Often they are very busy and I would imagine this plays a role in determining whether or not they have time to talk to customers. But it would be nice if they did. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, this Costa is decent. I've been to other locations with a better street view and better service. So my verdict is that they are good and not great. I'll come here as long as I am conveniently close by.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food'] This Costa is my favourite in Edinburgh, situated just outside the station on the uppermost floor of the mall. It is large and spacious, with high windows which let in a glorious flood of light if the sun happens to be shining.\n",

      "\n",
      "The coffee is brilliant but not the cheapest, although slightly cheaper than rival Starbucks. The food is ok, a real hit or a miss, and is mainly made up of sandwiches and paninis, crisps and cakes.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food'] It's like any costa around and in the city as its a chain. For me I would say this is my least favourite because if it's feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "It already feels dated in a sense that it's had a lot of footfall. The place has the normal costa decor but feels drained. On a hot day, it feels really muggy - I can't think what the staff must feel like working on the other side of the counter with all these machines turning out heat. It definitely needs better air-con.\n",
      "\n",
      "The seating arrangements annoy me. There's just too much fitted into a weird shape. \n",

      "It really needs some TLC.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food'] The only reason I'm not giving this a 1 star rating is because, eventually, you do end up with a cup of coffee that is more or less what you asked for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from that, I'm hard pushed to find good things to say about this particular branch of Costa; it's definitely my least favourite of all the city centre branches. For starters, it's always at least 5 degrees hotter in here than is ever really necessary. Not exactly what you want what you've just ordered a Venti piping hot drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is, of course, when you finally get your drink. On any given day you'll have to queue for about 10 minutes before you get to the front.

      "Fast Food ['Restaurants', 'Fast Food', 'Burgers'] Yes, they are open 24 hours - but that is the ONLY plus. The staff does NOT pay attention to what you are ordering and the orders NEVER come out correctly. You are always constantly asked to pull forward to wait for your food --- AND if you are lucky they won't forget that they asked you to pull forward and actually bring your food out to you. By far the worst service ever and if it wasn't the closest one by about 5 miles, we would DEFINITELY go to a different McDonald's. Also, the \"managers\" do not care if you complain or whatever you have to say. It is so frustrating.\n",

      "You told me you had \"Real Fruit Smoothies\" that were blended to perfection and offered at a reasonable price. You drilled that idea in my head for weeks with your incessant advertising on the sides of buses and mile high billboards with pictures of creamy, fruity smoothies that made my mouth salivate instantly. You knew that I loved smoothies so much that I would go to great and dangerous lengths to obtain one of your so called \"Real Fruit Smoothies\". You knew that even though I loathed you and everything you stand for, that I would risk it all, risk everything to venture into your mustard arches to try one of your smoothies. \n",

After I made my way through a throng of screaming kids running around barefoot, I finally made it to the counter. I decided to play it safe and order a strawberry banana smoothie thinking that you couldn't possibly mess that classic flavor up. I wasn't actually able to see you make this \"Real Fruit Smoothie\", as it was mysteriously whipped up behind the scenes in the back somewhere. I would say that next time I'll pay more attention, but unfortunately for you, there won't be a next time. \n",

      "Steakhouses ['American (New)', 'Steakhouses', 'Italian', 'Restaurants'] Going to make this quick. Left the house looking for something new. Jen wanted a burger. We drove to the Lone Butte Casino as we had never been. Walked the floor a bit looking around and came across the Verona Chophouse. Dark and brown with a quiet rustic feel. If it wasnt for the soft ringing of slot machines they probably could have charged double. We sat in the bar at the only table. A four seated high top surrounded by 8 glass chilling cabinets for wine. It was pretty cool actually and for not having reservations it was actually a better table than with the masses of blue hairs in the main dining room, lol. Although they did have a jazz trio playing mellow tunes that we could hear but not see out there. \n",

We sampled each other's dinner and OMG, both cooked perfectly and tender oh so tender. Regardless if you like to gamble, come here to eat. Our meals with salad, bread, and drinks,........only $75!  Food was 5 star restaurant worthy. I will definitely come back and rave about it to my friends.\n",

      "Steakhouses ['American (New)', 'Steakhouses', 'Italian', 'Restaurants'] Great place for inexpensive Sunday brunch. The food and service are top notch.

      "Steakhouses ['American (New)', 'Steakhouses', 'Italian', 'Restaurants'] So the BF was going to take me out to celebrate my new job (yay!), but forgot one tiny detail....where we were going..... nice. So now it's 7 o clock on a Friday night and we have no reservations and everywhere we call has at least an hour wait....So I take over this situation and used Yelp power to find this place, which was lucky because they had open reservations and were very good. \n",
      "\n",
      "The people who work here really know what they are doing. They are both friendly and professional. Our waiter Vinnie was great, he made very good suggestions when asked for them and was attentive. Additionally, their prices are extremely reasonable for the type of food offered and the restaurant has a nice atmosphere...very romantic (despite being in a casino). They make all of their pasta in house which is great, but it's kind of weird because they have a lady locked in a little red box with full length windows so you can watch her make pasta. I don't know how happy that would make me....but it is cool to see. Anyway, off of my tangent, we started with soup and salad (it comes with the meal) and they were good. I had the minestrone and, at first, I didn't like it because it was a bit thin, but after a few bites it was really good! The BF had the caesar salad with dressing on the side (he can't eat caesar dressing, but I can!) and it too was tasty. For mains, I had the filet (at Vinnie's recommendation) and it was really good. It is a filet on top of a 'risotto cake' aka fried cheesy goodness with spinach, mushrooms, and a balsamic glaze on it. I ordered the filet medium well because I am a crazy person about rare meat, but this kitchen sure knows how to cook a steak. It almost fell apart...so tender, not chewy at all, and had a lot of flavor. The BF got the porterhouse and it was good (but mine was better). I don't think he would order it again, only because other things on the menu are better, although It did come with the most buttery and tasty fingerling potatoes... really tasty. Again at Vinnie's recommendation (I'm glad he put up with me....), we got the ricotta cheesecake for dessert along with coffee. It was 4$ (for real?!?!) and it was soooo goood. It was creamy and sweet without being overly sweet. It had chocolate and caramel on it with raspberry (?) sauce underneath, fresh berries on the side, and a perfect quenelle (I totally had to look up that spelling... teehee) of whipped cream....and not just like redi-whip or something, but a thick, home made (tasting at least) whipped cream. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ready for the most surprising part? All of this food was 58$! That is crazy for the amount of steak we had. I would definitely come back here (maybe next time I'll try the lamb...mmmm).\n",
      "Steakhouses ['American (New)', 'Steakhouses', 'Italian', 'Restaurants'] We went there for the first time on Saturday and were very pleased with the service.  We ordered the fillet and a chicken parmesan.  The steak was fantastic, but the chicken parm was a bit overcooked.  Overall a very good experience, good atmosphere and service.  Oh yeah, prices... very reasonable!\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll be back\n",
      "Steakhouses ['American (New)', 'Steakhouses', 'Italian', 'Restaurants'] Ok, I have to hand it to Verona.  I said I would NEVER go back to this place after I went there several times in 2011 and it was awful service and food.  However, it appears they DID make some significant changes that cause me to update and upgrade my review since the last one (1 star on 8/15/11).  Plus, my friend had said that the place was pretty good now and convinced me to give it another try.   Had dinner here last night with a girlfriend and we sat at the bar.  Ordered a great bottle of pinot noir and then ordered dinner.  We both started with the house salad - delicious.  Goat cheese, greens and a great dressing that was light.  I had the chicken parmesan and she had the filet.  Both were amazing!!  The filet was huge and melted in your mouth.  The chicken parmesan was also a big serving but YUMMMMY!  The best part is we were able to use mostly comps to pay for it all, making it even better - FREE.  Nicely done, Verona.  I will be back.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['American (New)', 'Steakhouses', 'Italian', 'Restaurants'] Wow, this place has to be one of the worst dining experiences I've ever experienced.  This restaurant is trying to have the upscale steakhouses status.  I've had better steaks at Sizzler, no offense Sizzler.  The 8 of us went out on a Friday night to celebrate.  The restaurant was pretty dead and it took 2 1/2 hours to get out of there.  We waited forever to get drinks and to top it all off the steaks looked cheap and had very little flavor.  I had to ask for A-1 Steak Sauce.  lol.  We spoke to the manager regarding the slow service and he could care less.  All of us were very disappointed and we will NEVER go there again.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['American (New)', 'Steakhouses', 'Italian', 'Restaurants'] My husband and I come here for sunday brunch it is fantastic ..We will always take visitors here, we even enjoyed it for Easter Sunday , Service is wonderful plus u get to listen to Jazz the only thing is the jazz band (2 of thm) take way too many breaks we would like it if they stayed on set longer.\n",

The kitchen backed them up with excellent food and desserts.  We didn't have any pre-conceived notions or expectations but found this restaurant inside Lone Butte Casino to be worthy of our repeat business.  I had the parmesan crusted chicken and my wife had the short ribs, both were prepared and presented perfectly.  The creme brulee and chocolate cake were also amazing finishes to our dining experience.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['American (New)', 'Steakhouses', 'Italian', 'Restaurants'] If Verona Chophouse had a theme song it would be \"So Fresh, So Clean\" by Outkast.

      "Steakhouses ['American (New)', 'Steakhouses', 'Italian', 'Restaurants'] Visited here for the first time, yesterday for Brunch. Everything was fresh and fabulous! I like how they didn't spread themselves too thin and offer too many dishes, which usually compromises on quality and taste. \n",
      "\n",
      "There were 4 stations - 1) the salad bar, cheese & meats, incredible grilled veggies and shrimp cocktail - 2) omelette bar (which I didn't try but my husband loved it) 3): scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage (which were delicious), garlic home fries (again terrific!) french toast stuffed with cannoli filling(yum!)-followed by a pancetta mac & cheese, an asian chicken dish and prime rib. I usually don't enjoy \"buffet\" style prime rib but Verona's was very flavorful and enjoyable. 4) Desert - I was actually disappointed by the selections, considering I LOVE chocolate- chocolate was only used as a decorative element. The mini cannoli were really good, however the shells were a bit stale and not as fresh as I usually like them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The staff was very attentive and had a great eye for detail. There was always someone refilling dishes or tidying things up. The food was surprisingly very good and fresh and we plan on going back.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only downside is if you are not a smoker, just walking through the casino to get to and from Verona's - my clothes and my hair had that horrible \"casino aroma\" of cigarette smoke. Luckily, Verona Chophouse is smoke-free and did not have such a smell.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['American (New)', 'Steakhouses', 'Italian', 'Restaurants'] This review is for the Sunday Jazz Brunch Buffet.  This past Sunday I got together with Mike C, Rand H and Arlin B for this wonderful brunch.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Technically I'd give this review 4.5 stars - if you are a small party (less than 8) they try and seat you in one of those half oval booths.  It would be nice and comfortable for a sit down meal, but makes getting in and out for a buffet a little more difficult.  Fortunately they were able to accommodate us with a small table.  The Sun buffet brunch is reasonably priced at $19.99 and includes coffee, tea and soft drinks.  Orange juice is $2 extra and mimosa's are $5.  But don't let that stop you from coming here for the food.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have a nice selection of italian deli meats, cheeses, roasted veggies and more items for salad.  The roasted veggies were really good and a nice touch from raw and/or overcooked veggies you find other places.  Compared to other brunch buffets the selections aren't as many, but I think the quality is far above the rest.  The star of the meal was the prime rib; and not just a tiny thin slice, they will slice it nice and thick at your request.  They offer a creamy horseradish sauce with it, but it needed more horseradish as it tasted mostly like sour cream.  The scalloped potatoes were fantastic and the peas with pearl onions and bacon rounded out the plate.  Delicious!!  The have an omelet station but after the prime rib, that would have been overkill.  A small selection of okay desserts rounded out the meal. \n",
      "\n",
      "The room is dark wood, just as you might expect in a steak house - and they have a lovely outside seating area as well.  I think if it were 5-10 degrees warmer, I would much rather have sat outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love the jazz duet, they weren't too loud and it was a nice accompaniment to our meal.\n",

      "\n",
      "My major gripe about this Arby's is in their haste to always upsell you they charge you more than what you order. I upgrade my drink size but it doesn't mean I want their gigantic curly fries. I finally had to read the riot act today and spell it out for them. Many years ago you would get a print out receipt of every item you ordered. These days you get the total you were charged on your credit card but you don't have any idea if you were charged correctly on each item.\n",

Never a fan with drive-thru service because I don't know if they really put what you order in the bag, I always have to double check everything.  If you dine-in and really enjoy their service, there's a bell by the door that you can ring, pretty neat.\n",
      "Fast Food ['Restaurants', 'Sandwiches', 'Burgers', 'Fast Food'] Although I'm a great fan of Arby's roast beef I have to honestly say that the apple crisp was one of the worst tasting things I have ever eaten at Arby's.\n",
      "Fast Food ['Restaurants', 'Sandwiches', 'Burgers', 'Fast Food'] This location has the really cool original Arby's sign and I have given it several chances because I want it to be good. I love Arbys,however this location sucks! They gave me a flat soda to wash down my cold beef & cheddar. I do drive thu and eat and drive. This has happened one to many times. I will be eating something els and I just want others to know.\n",

      "Mr. Starbucks Barista took his bloody time making one of the simplest Starbucks drinks known to man! As a result, a non-customer (person who didn't purchase anything) took the only seat available in this puny Starbucks. This seat was going to be mine, if Mr. Starbucks server dude had put my tea in the correct sized cup in the first place and didn't chat up a storm with another employee while pouring the hot water in the cup!!!! \n",

      "*Sighs*\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Food', 'Coffee & Tea'] Great atmosphere I've come to expect from Starbucks. Really amiable, accommodating baristas. And they offer alcohol!\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Food', 'Coffee & Tea'] Absolutely the worst starbucks! The workers talk way to much. It's 7:30 am I want my damn coffee and be on my way. No they aren't just being friendly and talking to me they're talking to each other and taking forever to make my coffee! I don't have time for this at 7:30 am! The manager was there the other day and she was one of the annoying people talking like honestly you're running a business it's busy and people are waiting for their drinks! \n",
      "\n",
      "The drinks just like any other starbucks but really I can't handle the chit chat when I'm waiting on my drink. I feel like when I'm paying $6.50 for a coffee I should have it promptly the worst part is there is rarely anyone ahead of me and I still wind up waiting forever for these people to make my coffee... What this location needs is all new staff preferably people who talk less.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Food', 'Coffee & Tea'] I'm at this Starbucks right now. It's kind of your run of the mill Starbucks.  You pay 3$ for a coffee and 2 $ for a cookie.  I'm only here because my Internet connection is still not installed in my new place (damn you power outage for having to reschedule the installation time).  Starting July 1, 2010, all Starbucks in Canada give free wireless!! Basically its the same as the other 3000 starbucks in Toronto.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Food', 'Coffee & Tea'] I know for a fact that satisfaction with your Starbucks visit lies a lot on the barista preparing your coffee. I've been coming here a lot whenever I need some downtime to read, and the baristas are terrific. They are friendly, attentive, and welcoming, and make fantastic coffee. During the holidays, they have made me cups upon cups of peppermint mocha, and currently they have never disappointed me with my skinny caramel flan latte. Sometimes I'd get caramel flan latte from a different location but for some reason it isn't as good. The place is a bit small but usually you can find yourself a good spot if you come at an off time like 1pm. The only negative thing about this particular Starbucks is it gets crowded and noisy around 2:30pm because of students coming after classes. Yesterday I was here and decided to get a skinny caramel ribbon crunch frap right at the start of frappuccino happy hour at 3pm. So, I was there in line with the high schoolers and was wondering if I'd get the same quality drinks. Turns out, I was not disappointed. Despite the flurry of orders, they still got mine correctly within a reasonable amount of time. Cheers, I love the baristas here!\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Food', 'Coffee & Tea'] Busy Starbucks\n",
      "\n",
      "Just another Starbucks\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Food', 'Coffee & Tea'] Was meeting a friend in the area; we were planning a presentation so decided to go to a coffee shop with free WiFi. Anyway, at no fault of the Starbucks, this place was packed with high schoolers hogging a number of seats. For a Thursday afternoon, it was very busy. We ended up just getting our lattes and looking for another venue. The Barrista prepared our drinks quickly and they were good. Anyway, I live nowhere close to this place so it won't be my go-to shop, but it did the trick when I needed my caffeine fix before preparing a presentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good for: coffee products\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food'] Excellent bagels. Best in Scottsdale. Service really good and they don't mess up my order. Have eaten here a lot in the last 4 weeks as my wife is in the hospital across the street. \n",
      "Glad I found this place.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food'] We have been going there for years when it was Einstein but it is not the same place since it became Caribou.  Last time I was there I said I was not coming back -- but I did unfortunately.  Ordered lox and cream cheese.  They got half way through the order and said they only had enough lox for half.  The rest was frozen.  So they made half and gave a refund.  The half they made was very thin on lox and the cream cheese was almost non existent. we will not be coming back and will go to another Einstein unless they all become Caribous.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food'] The worst part about this place is that the Caribou coffee is delicious. Unfortunately, it not delicious enough to put up with the horrible customer service. I went today to get coffee and bagels and after waiting for 15 minutes in a line that did not move I walked out and will not go back until they get new management. This location was fabulous when Josh was in charge. We we go a few times a week. Since he left it has been a in a death spiral. Our visits have dwindled and after today we will not be back. The wait is unreasonably long, orders are often mixed up and customers are visibly unhappy. We were not the first ones to walk out today. I cannot understand why corporate does nothing to get this store to function properly. With so many coffee shops out there I cannot justify coming here.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food'] I love Caribou coffee. This place though is so badly disorganized that it feels like it takes forever to get anywhere. People are routinely annoyed and every time I'm here there are way too many apologies being given by staff. If they could get the service piece in order (everyone is running around doing everything) they'd get the 5th star.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food'] I love Einstein's Bagels, but I've never experienced such disorganization at any store like I did at this one. It should never take 20 minutes to make one toasted bagel with cream cheese. I don't know if it's because this certain location has teamed up with Caribou coffee but I think having the coffee bar behind the counter slows down everything considerdably. They should stick with what has worked at other stores and let the customer make their own coffee and it would free up people working behind the counter. Everyone just looked pissed off and disappointed waiting for their orders. I will never return to this location again.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food'] I am so sad to say that the employees working at this Caribou are ruining the fabulous 'caribou' image.  We were so excited to have a caribou in town since the coffee is delicious, but I have had way too many poor visits that I will not be going back.  I keep trying to give them more chances but I'm done.  I have waited for 15 minutes for ONE drink the last 2 times I've gone in.  They always have trouble with their computers and can never figure out how to run my gift card.  I always order an iced caramel crafted press and they always look at me like I'm crazy, it's right on the menu!  I'm so sad that they can't get their acts together and have better management take over.  If things don't change we are going to lose a good coffee shop in town.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food'] Waited in line to get a dozen bagels only to find that they are out of most bagel choices. Its only 9:30 am Saturday!\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food'] Best coffee ever. Worst customer service or poor management. Just stopped by tonight and waited for 7 minites. Not one employee ever showed up at the register to take my order. Sadly not even the first time I've had a bad experience here. I came last week at 6pm during the week and they were closed....no sign or explanation (normal closing is 9pm).  I'm just over this place after tonight. Better to just go to Starbucks on the other side of the hospital.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food'] I like it here because it is really fast in the morning. Sometimes when the line at Starbucks is too long, I just drive over here. Caribou Coffee is much smoother and less assertive than Starbucks so I'll double the espresso to achieve the right level of coffee taste. Plus great bagels and generally nice customer service.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food'] These people are idiots.   I sent my husband in this morning with a coupon. They told him that they couldn't except it because they are NOT Einstein anymore \n",

      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food'] I'm not sure if I wrote a review on this location before, but I would like to start by saying, I love Einstien Bagels!  Now I will tell you that this specific location can't manage themselves let alone a restaurant,,, yes a restaurant has a menu and carries the items on the menu!!  This never appears to happen at this location.  Always out of bagels, out of chicken salad out of cream cheese and the list goes on.  Very hard to be a customer when there is never any consistency.  This restaurant has been mismanaged since it's inception!  I hope management reads this!!\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food'] Great Coffee and Customer Service... However I find it VERY ODD that there are 13+ cameras in the lobby, and more behind the counter. Additionally there's no courtesy signs to alert you of the use of cameras.  There is an acceptable use for cameras- this is unacceptable.  I will no longer bring clients and my business to this establishment! Very disappointed!\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food'] Horribly disorganized, I was the second person in line over a 15 minute wait.  In addition trying serve the customers standing in line they take overs the phone!!!Everything comes to a halt......Clearly bad management.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food'] I love the coffee and I am happy they are here. However poor customer service, the \"manager\" has no clue.  Would not let me use a coupon and a carbon perk when they are 2 different things. You have lost a customer and my business.\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Restaurants', 'Nightlife', 'Bars'] I went to this Keg for a work lunch around Christmastime. \n",
      "The starters were delicious, we had both MUSHROOMS NEPTUNE (mushroom caps, crab, cream cheese), and SCALLOPS & BACON (scallops wrapped in smoked bacon with a cocktail sauce), but the main was disappointing. I have had prime rib with mashed potatoes at the Keg before and it was good, but I was trying to be healthy and there isn't much in the way of veggies on offer. So I ordered the prime rib with asparagus and everything was just bland. Meat not seasoned, plain steamed asparagus not seasoned, and the horseradish was so strong it nearly killed me, I thought I was going to black out after one little dollop. So if you are going to get the prime rib, get it with the mashed potatoes. Everything is like every other Keg, dim lighting,communal parking lot (free), full bar. Service was good, my meat was a bit more rare than I ordered and somebody else's came more well-done than they requested, but overall it was fine.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Restaurants', 'Nightlife', 'Bars'] I had a great dining experience at this location. The  calamari is a good selection prepared crispy and very tasty and not limply and oily. The salmon and the steak are excellent and desert was amazing. The service was also very satisfactory. I would certainly dine here again.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Restaurants', 'Nightlife', 'Bars'] While I did not love the bleu cheese dressing on my wedge, I was impressed with the filet and the roasted mixed veg.  The salad dressing was sweet. Yes a sweet bleu cheese dressing and too much bacon and diced tomatoes covered the wedge. An unsophisticated preparation which is incongruous with the finely prepared filet. Of course, this is a chain restaurant, but they serve some fine cuts of meat and I just wish the salad was a bit more artfully executed with subtle savory flavors.\n",

That being said, weekends and holidays are the biggest b word ever. Expect an hour wait at LEAST. This place gets packed easily and it's craaaazy. The venue is huge too and it's not super spacious between tables, so it feels like sardines in a can. \n",
      "\n",
      "The steak is good. It's nothing to write home about but what really puts me off sometimes is I order a $40-50 steak and they literally give me 3 beans and 1 red pepper slice. Not even joking. After a bacon wrapped anything I would like to at least pretend I am healthy!\n",
      "\n",
      "I give the Keg a 3.5. The experience is good and classic, but they are lacking excitement and the portions are whack.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Steakhouses', 'Restaurants', 'Nightlife', 'Bars'] So disappointed. I moved to Connecticut about a year ago from the GTA. There are a number of things that I miss about canada - the keg is a huge one - or at least it was. \n",

They also seem to be skimping on the crispy onions too. Used to get a good pile - now it looks like they're trying to save money. \n",

Asked for more bread when entrees arrived and was completely forgotten about. Did not check in on us the rest of the meal. Took another half hour after we had already finished our meal to flag down the server for the bill. Food was good but would never come back due to the dreadful service. I would give this less than a one star if I could!!\n",

      "Fast Food ['Restaurants', 'Caribbean', 'Fast Food'] This place should be named Always Closed, ive been here all week wanting some Jamaican food and this is the closest one to my hotel but every time I go there they are closed.\n",
      "Fast Food ['Restaurants', 'Caribbean', 'Fast Food'] The food here is amazing! I had the curry chicken with rice and peas and the potato salad. Loved the plantains.The people are so wonderful as well. I received great service. This is definitely a place I will keep coming back to.\n",
      "Fast Food ['Restaurants', 'Caribbean', 'Fast Food'] Finally made it here and I was amazed. The jerk chicken was fantastic and the curry goat was delicious. The staff was friendly and recommended the kola champagne soda and I was not disappointed. They even sold us a bottle of the hot sauce. We will definitely be back.\n",
      "Fast Food ['Restaurants', 'Caribbean', 'Fast Food'] This is my second time getting food from this place. The complaint I had the first time was that the portions seemed small for the price. That was so long ago that I can't remember if it's improved, but the portion seemed small again. This time it seems I got day old chicken that needed to unload at the end of the day because the jerk chicken I bought was over cooked and EXTREMELY tough. I think I'm done now. I won't be going back.\n",

      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Restaurants', 'Chicken Wings'] The GOODYEAR Rosati's has always been very good to us!  I think their menu has changed over the past 6 years or so, but the pizza remains outstanding!  We normally went for the thin crust combo - very basic, very excellent crust!  The toppings are so good that it doesn't need a ton of crust to make up for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have yet to try their deep dish or Chicago style pie but it's on the list of \"to try\" items.  I'm working in the middle of Phoenix right now, so I'll be trying the location close to the airport.  But when we lived in Goodyear, Rosati's was as good as it gets!  Memorable enough that I always get a pizza from here when I get the chance to stop by Goodyear for old times' sake!\n",
      "\n",
      "**UPDATE** I have since had their deep dish Chicago pie twice and it is unbelievable - count yourself lucky, Phoenix, to have access to this type of pizza in your area - it's a rare treat!\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Restaurants', 'Chicken Wings'] Too bad Rosatti's has jacked up their prices... I just cancelled the order to go with NYPD as even before coupon they are a much better value and NYPD is a superior pizza!\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Restaurants', 'Chicken Wings'] This Rosati's pizza lacked the quality I've had at other Rosati's pizza. They overcooked it and it had a slightly charred flavor to it, both times I went to this place. The customer service was poor both times because I felt rushed and the employees did not care to help me and seemed like they would rather be someplace else. I'm not saying all Rosati's are bad because I also frequent the Rosati's at 28th and Thunderbird, and it is fantastic compared to this one (Both in customer service and food).\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Restaurants', 'Chicken Wings'] I have some friends that live in the Phoenix area that I visit every year.  They brought this for take out and personally, I think it's the best pizza.  I realize everyone has their own tastes but for me this does it.  Great taste.  Thick pieces.  Fantastic.\n",

      "However, beware of the male boss when you are there with little ones.  I brought my kids there recently and totally regretted it.  The male boss cursed when we asked for the tapioca dessert.  The waitress said something to him and he went on a loud cursing rant,  calling her the B word and screaming the F and S words many times,  all the while customers with little kids were there... It was horrific.  I will not dine in there anymore when the male boss is present.  He seemed intoxicated and violent. Don't go there if he is around.  I would call ahead of time, to make sure he is not there.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I never gave this place a try, because the photos makes me think this is only for American Chinese food. Until a few days ago, I came to eat with my friends, and I realized they make authentic Cantonese food.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered steam fish(清蒸鲫鱼), chicken with green onions(葱爆鸡), beef with bitter melon(苦瓜牛肉), west lake beef soup(西湖牛肉羹), etc. Everything was good, not 5 start good, but good compare to most of the Chinese restaurant around this area. It is now my top 5 Chinese restaurant to go around Chandler and Tempe area.\n",

      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I drove yesterday to a particular Chinese restaurant to have lunch since I was super hungry due to fasting for over 24 hours.  When I got there, I discovered I forgot my wallet and had to drive back to my office to get it.  Now I was really hungry so I went to Tao Garden which is half a mile down the street from me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since I was super hungry, I actually ordered two lunches.  One was a big order of char siu chow funn (dry) with extra bean sprouts.  The other lunch was one of their lunch specials - beef bitter melon over rice (rice plate).  Both were excellent.  I think they had the sliced bitter melon soaking in a baking soda solution, since it was very bright green even after cooking and the portion of beef was pretty good too.  Both dishes were consumed in total by me -- albeit it was a little struggle, but I did finish both of my lunches.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Still pretty good Cantonese food for the price.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I used to love this place but it really went downhill. It took an 15 minutes just to get the menus and another thirty for the first dish to arrive. We saw a waitress but she said she wasn't qualified to take our orders and left us. Took another half hour for the main dishes to arrive. The food was okay but not as good as it used to. We finished the food in 30 minutes but stayed for another half hour because nobody would give us the check.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Food was okay. All the dishes there are good. However, the owner is insane! When we walked in, my brother wanted to look at the fish, then the owner stopped and yelled at him cursing and completely ignoring my family like we weren't there while on the phone. Honestly I think if he keeps doing what he's doing, business is going to go out soon.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] not a fan. Ordered the lunch special and it was barely eatable.  I would've sent it back but I was being nice. Won't be back.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Mmmmm, best Chinese food around.  My family has been going here for years; a diamond in the rough.  Super-delicious.  On my way there now to pick up food for my daughter's b-day.  She got to pick from any restaurant in town... what does that tell ya?\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] My daughter and I and her two little ones, a 2 1/2  and 15 months old came for an early dinner on May 29th.  I had never been there, my daughter had and she said food was good.  We were the only patrons in the restaurant.  The atmosphere was nice and restaurant clean.  Our waitress was very attentive and quick to please.  She seemed to anticipate our every need especially the little ones which is really rare.  It was nice not to keep having to ask for anything as in most restaurants, especially,  when you bring the little ones.  We ordered the family dinner for two. The wonton soup was good as were the potstickers. We had the chicken and vegetables and the prawns with cashews.  It was all delicious and plenty of food.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I would have given the restaurant 5 stars had it not been for the owner and/or manager.  He was a bully of a mean man.  We were thoroughly enjoying our meal with the babies when he came out and noticed the thermostat and started to yell and curse about someone having it too low.  He hiked it up to 78 to our dismay, but since we weren't going to stay long with the little ones, we said nothing.  Then he came near our table and started to yell about one of his male workers being stupid and lazy, but stupid seemed to be his favorite word.  He said he was worthless amongst many other negative adjectives as the man was near us busy working.  The worker's head was hanging and looked so pathetic like he was used to being treated that way.  My daughter said nothing, but I tried to lighten the mood by saying positive things to the owner/manager.  He would not hear of it and went on with his rant.  I finally gave up and didn't acknowledge him anymore.  Had he not gotten quiet I was getting ready to say something, but he stopped and moved away from us.  The whole fiasco ruined what we wanted and had hoped to have a nice dinner out for a change.  We usually order Chinese food in because of the little ones.  Needless to say, he ruined our dinner and we won't be coming back despite the good food and the wonderful service from our great waitress.  :(\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I love this place, it is a bit gritty but wonderful. I am not Asian but lived with first generation Chinese for many years. This is how we ate at home. I order off the menu items all the time. They are very accommodating. This is not fancy and if your looking for great service this is not it.  It is however a great place to eat and enjoy a great meal. It reminds me of being at a family's house. It is warm and full of life. I have eaten everything here and do recommend all the food, try something new.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Service was poor. Many Asians seemed to receive good service while we waited over 15 minutes and never got our order taken despite mentioning our need to order to two wait staff. We left without ordering.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] This is an update almost 10 years later. The owner hasn't changed, but the quality of service has gone down like free fall. Foods are tasty, but the attitude of the staff and owner are just not acceptable. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would just take out instead of dine-in at the restaurant. I also don't want their white rice. They have history to put customer unfinished rice back to the rice cooker.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Tao Garden is great.  It is one of the best family-style, Chinese restaurants in the East Valley (along with Best Hong Kong Dining in Mesa).  The quality is great and so are the portions and prices.  It reminds me of any of the authentic, decent Chinese food restaurants that I grew up with in the Bay Area.  I would highly recommend Tao Garden if you are looking for something other than Panda-Express like, American-style Chinese food.  (BTW, I had no idea what a crab puff was before I moved to AZ., and so I thank goodness that I found a place like Tao Garden before too long).\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] We love getting take-out from this gem, occasionally eat there. When we go there, the service is very attentive and quick.  The food never disappoints dine-in or take-out.  We have tried many items there, mostly vegetarian. Our favorites are sweet and sour fish, thai fried rice, eggplant in garlic sauce, and the sauce is amazing, if a little greasy, broccoli in garlic sauce. They give large take out orders on crates so its easy to care out and reduces spillage.  also to be mentioned are the cheap cocktail and beer prices. cant wait to go again soon.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Very disappointed ... Horrible service! If this was our first time here we would not ever be back. We will never come on a busy night again. The waitress actually actually told us to serve ourselves. Good thing the food is good.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Our family favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area  the restaurant itself is humble but has consistently delicious food and good portions! We love their fish & tofu dish and somehow managed to get it on every visit. My younger brothers favorite part Tao Garden is they provide a complementary sweet dessert soup at the end of the meal  it's a little too sweet for my taste but a nice addition nevertheless.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Somewhere between 3-4 stars. I'd say this is one of the better Chinese restaurants in Phoenix. Decor/ambience is kind of old and unglamorous, but the food is pretty good and decently priced. We went on a weekday evening, so it was pretty empty and service was good. For a group of 6 plus a toddler, we ordered 1 soup and 6 dishes, which was the perfect amount of food: \n",
      "* fish soup - not much fish meat, not really a fan of the chewy yellow stuff, but flavor was good\n",
      "* Mongolian beef - good, one of the best dishes we got, would order again (but you better like lots of onions)\n",
      "* honey walnut shrimp - yummy, big pieces of shrimp, not too much mayo\n",
      "* sautéed green beans - good, not too salty or overcooked\n",
      "* mapo tofu - just ok, not spicy enough, wouldn't order again\n",
      "* steamed whole fish - tender but slightly chewy tilapia, good sauce, would order again\n",
      "* fried salty pork chop - average/good\n",
      "\n",
      "They also provide complimentary dessert besides fortune cookies: warm sweet soup with small tapioca pearls. It's tasty but very sweet and very thick. Looked like there was a red bean or two in there.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] The food is good love the shrimp chow mein . nice inviorment and clean. Would recommend it to friends and family.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] We've eaten here or gotten take out many times from here and I felt it was time to put my two cents in.  It is by far the best Chinese restaurant in Chandler area.  The food is very authentic and the menu huge.  Almost everything that we have tried is awesome.  Stray away from the Americanized dishes d try the unfamiliar like the dry sauteed green beans and stir fried snow pea shoots.  You won't be sorry. (unless you like the Panda- then you will not like it)\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Ok after careful deliberation I am a fan of Tao's.. \n",
      "\n",
      "I like their Beef & Chinese Broccoli.. But my favorite is the Mongolian Beef and their BBQ Pork slices..\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] This place has good food, it lost stars 1 for price and 2 because one of the ladies waiting on us knew no English....and pushed water on us (not physically) instead of just taking our order for drinks\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] The food may not be bad but there's a guy with such a foul mouth there, which does not make it a kid friendly place.  That same guy was so rude to my kids; he even mumbled I don't like kids.  Our kids were not loud nor did they misbehave.  Now I remember why we did not patron this place for several years.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Really more like 3.5 stars... Here's why - All the food here is very good and very authentic and a good quantity for the price. The service has been bad 75% of the time I have been there/ The service and the bad decor is why it did not get a better rating.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Their website shows one price for the menu, but when i called to place an order for take out they said they cannot serve me for that price and I would have to dine in for that.  That is fine with me IF they would mention that anywhere on the website.  \n",
      "\n",
      "They wasted my time and tried to pull some sketchy maneuver to make an extra buck. I'll gladly eat at ANY of the dozens of other places in the area.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I decided to try out this place for dinner. I ordered the Peking style roasted duck and beef chow fun. Both dishes were good but the only thing I need to gripe about is the Peking duck or more like the lack of Peking duck. They only brought out the skin of the duck and there was no duck meat. The dish that we got only consist of the buns, duck skin, scallions and sauce. What??! \n",
      "\n",
      "At other restaurants like Hong Kong Gourmet on Dobson they give you the skin and the meat. I asked the waitress and she said that's all it comes with. Needless to say this dish will not be receiving another review next time. Also the food took at least 45 minutes to come to our table, and I notice it was like that at the other tables as well. I'm not sure if I will be giving it a second chance next time around.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Food is excellent there.  I LOVE the beef chow fun.  One of the best in town.  Staffs are friendly and quite speedy when place an order.  Sometime I bring friends and families there for lunch or dinner.  I would recommend this place to Chinese Food lover.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] 45 minutes for a carry out order and they were still 15 late!  That's unacceptable regardless of how good the food is.  There are a ton of Asian restaurants and I can drive a long way in 45 min.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Stephen took me to lunch here a couple weeks ago.  I thought it was gonna be nicer inside for some reason.  It was plain, kinda old looking.  The food was pretty good... nothing spectacular.  I had some spicy chicken thing.  I think Stephen had Cashew or Almond chicken.  It came with soup (it was ok, kind goopey), an eggroll (really gross) and a wonton thingy (good).   They give you quite a lot and its inexpensive for lunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not dying to go back but its WAY better than chinese fast food, which I would rather die than eat.  Sorry but you suck ass Panda Express!  Can you say \"food poisoning\"?  Can you say \"been sitting there all effin day\"?\n",
      "\n",
      "NEWAYS...\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, service wasn't great, but it hardly is at asian places - I'm not trying to be an asshole by saying that but I have experience with a few chinese/filipino grammas, know what I'm sayin?\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway... it was like whatever. HEHE...\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I don't like Tao Garden because it sounds like my name, I like Tao's because they serve great Chinese food. This is one of my go to spots when I'm craving Chinese. It doesn't hurt that the I leave Tao's feeling full like my wallet! They have great lunch specials and their dinner menu is decently priced as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "I recommend trying some of their specials if you want something different; their specials never disappoint. I order their pea pod leaves every time, but that recommendation is for those who like veggies.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] My family and I went. It smelled like pee. We waited 10 minutes for water. then decided to leave since the waiter kept walking by telling us just a minute. I'll never go there again.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] If you like Chinese food, you'll like Tao Garden.  It's standard, tasty Chinese food, and the menu is HUGE.  They have tons of different chow meins, lo meins, tofu dishes, seafood dishes and soups, so it makes it hard to choose.  The veggie spring rolls are delish and crispy, but it's kinda hard to screw those up if you ask me.  The sauce they come with is amazing too.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't really have a problem with slow service as one of the other reviews noted either.  My server was pretty good, although he could have been a little more attentive.  All in all, I liked this place and would definitely come back for more.  Prices aren't bad and you can find coupons in the New Times every now and then.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I did not give them a 2 star for their food it was good i gave them 2 stars for their customer service. after ordering the waitresses stood behind my wife the whole meal making it very uncomfortable and after that i went to go pay the bill was going to tip with cash when they vocally and loudly called me out on not leaving one when i said i was leaving a tip to where the other patrons could hear. the customer service is bad and them trying to embarass me into leving a tip will be why i will not be going back.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] 3.75 STARS*\n",
      "\n",
      "My family always seems to stop by this little restaurant every time we drive through Phoenix. This place used to be extremely busy but the last couple times it's been kind of slow :( On a positive note, the servers are more attentive and they seem to be paying attention to small details that were once overlooked. \n",
      "\n",
      "The food here is consistently good, not California Chinese restaurant amazing but still pretty delicious. It reminds me of something my parents would make at home. Portion sizes vary from visit to visit, however it still within reason for their cheap prices.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I've had numerous good experiences with food and service at this restaurant and will continue to come here.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] This is one of my favorite places to eat when I come to Phoenix.  I get weary of reading reviews taking shots at restaurants for not serving \"real Chinese food.\"  The standard is going to be different wherever anybody goes.  Chinese food here is not going to be the same in California and California Chinese food will not be the same as in any of the many cities in China.  They are all different among the various regions of that country as well.  I am a Chinese-American and my parents are from China.  We all enjoy Tao Garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Peking Duck, Ma Po Tofu and Short Ribs in Black Pepper Sauce are my favorites.  The service is good, although it could be improved.  I've seen the waiters walk away before customers are finished with instructions for their orders several times there.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The restroom does smell bad as somebody else pointed out.  I think it's due to the floor drain in the middle of the restroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure, they could improve somethings but I go there for one reason and that is to enjoy a good meal.  I've never had a bad meal at this place and have always thoroughly enjoyed my Peking duck.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Far and away the best Chinese food in the valley. The Hot and Sour soup is the bar I judge all others by. Our favorite dishes are the Mongolian Beef, Spicy Garlic Chicken, and the Shrimp Lo Mein. The owner will talk your ear off but that is part of the charm.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] By far the best Cantonese food I've had since we moved from NY. Good spare ribs, great service and family owned. Everyone should make an extra effort to come to this awesome place!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I would give this place 4 stars as it is among the best in the valley.  Not saying much though as their are way too many mediocre chinese joints in the valley. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since there is no Wanton Soup (huh?) I also had to take it down a notch.  The good parts are the Service is very good and for lunch it is very affordable.  Had the Chicken with spicy garlic sauce for $4.95 lunch special.  Huge plate.  Great Meal. Would go again.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Came here for dinner with 11 in our party and everything was excellent.  Had Peking  pork chops; green beans;  whole steamed chicken with ginger and garlic chicken; sauté fish fillet;  shredded pork with spicy garlic sauce;  salted fish and chicken with tofu;  broccoli beef;  and seafood and fried tofu.  Food came out fairly quickly;  service was much better than average for a Chinese restaurant.  Decor is a bit dated.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I've been coming here for years.  It's always a treat to stop by Tao Garden for dinner.  The decor is that of all Chinese restaurants so don't expect to be wow'd.  \n",
      "\n",
      "While my family normally gets the \"set\" dinners but if I stop in with friends, we normally just choose a few items from the menu.  Some of my favorites are the walnut shrimp, the crab with ginger and onion, Peking pork chops, and the Peking duck [ although be warned, they only give you the skin with the buns and scallions --- no meat :( ].\n",
      "\n",
      "The service here is pretty decent.  Some nights are better than others but I attribute it to how busy it can get during the dinner rush.  The waitresses are always nice and and attentive regardless of how busy it can get.  While their actual social skills do favor the Chinese, they're always polite.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I've been here twice so far, and it is pretty good. Amazing service, and great atmosphere. I would have given them 5 stars, but the General Tso's chicken i was in search of was not that good.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Tao Garden is one of the gems of Phoenix, AZ. I am originally from San Diego but traveled different places trying different Chinese food in each city. The reason why I love this place is because of the low standards each Chinese restaurants raise in the Phoenix area. With that considered, Tao Garden is the best. There are some Chinese restaurants you go into and for a decent meal overpay by a large margin. However, there also really cheap Chinese places where the food smells like it has been in the fridge for a couple weeks. Tao Garden provides a decent meal while serving at a really low price. It is not the BEST Chinese food I have tasted but I am so appreciative of this place. That is why I am giving this place 5 stars! In the midst of horrendous Chinese food in the Phoenix area, Tao Garden has provided the two tier demand I want from every Chinese food-good meal at low price. \n",
      "\n",
      "Try the sweet and sour pork, beef chow fun with black bean sauce, honey walnut shrimp, and duck. (I know I order like a gwai lo, but my goodness this stuff is like heaven!)\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Good Food. Good Prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can't go too long without ordering from Tao Garden. They have authentic Chinese food that we like.\n",
      "They recently raised their prices, but still are quite reasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are a list of the must have in no particular order:\n",
      "Steamed Chicken w/ Ginger & Scallions\n",
      "Mongolian Beef\n",
      "Peking Pork Chop (similar to Sweet & Sour Pork)\n",
      "Pork Chop w/ Salty Pepper\n",

      "Sauteed Beef & Bitter Melon (a little bitter tast)\n",
      "Deep Fried Chicken Filet\n",
      "Steamed Fish\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Let me start out by saying that the food here is probably the best in the south valley.  Service is very good also - the owners wife and other wait staff do a great job.  The reason I will never go again is the owner.  Twice we have been to the restaurant and he has been loud, obnoxious, and drunk.  The first time happened several years ago on Christmas Day.  He cursed loudly, dropped the f bomb many times however I thought well it's Christmas so maybe he was celebrating early.  The next time happened about two months ago.  I brought my three year old and my husband there for lunch.  The owner came into the restaurant and started cursing loudly.  I was so upset I walked up to him and asked him to stop.  The wait staff thanked me for saying something.  I will never go to Tao garden again.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Nice staff. Okay food. Took forever to get my food. No reason to come back.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] This is probably one of the better Chinese restaurants in the area. I live down the street, and given the myriad of quality Chinese places around me, this is still my choice most of the time. They've got some great authentic dishes, but still have your standard safe options for the less adventurous. They have fresh seafood and specials depending on the availability of ingredients. One thing I like about them is that the chow mein, fried rice, chow fun, and rice noodles here are priced reasonably compared to other places at around $5.50. I'm constantly surprised at how much consumers are gouged for rice or noodles that cost almost nothing. If I can buy a bag of rice for $10 and make rice for a small army, why do I get charged $8 for a small portion with some meat and veggies added. Thank you Tao Garden for not trying to screw us over. \n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, the food here really is great and as authentic as you would want. I recommend the salt and pepper pork chop, the beef stew(not for the faint of heart beef eaters, i.e. tripe and tendon), singapore rice noodles, kung pao chicken, and curry chicken. \n",
      "\n",
      "As I've said before, don't go to a Chinese restaurant expecting good service. You'll be disappointed almost anytime. Look for great food, and let the food speak for itself.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Peking duck was crispy and delicious! It was served with soft, warm buns, hoisin sauce and fine green onion threads, only thing missing was the cucumbers.  Also wished they had the option of having it served 2 or 3 ways (ie. Soup and stir fried noodles)\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] The food here is really good! The prices are really cheap and the portion size are enough to feed 3 people. The lady is SUPER nice, but she just needs to be more attentive.. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would come here once in awhile not all the time cause you can get really tired of eating the same type of foods. \n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the food was good, came out really fast. I would come here again.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Shocked, really.  We were regulars at Tao Garden until it received a health violation.  Believing things had been corrected, we returned after a few months.  Food was wonderful, as always, and we felt like all was well.  However, we soon felt threatened by the owner\n",
      " who yelled the \"F\" word and \"B\" word at my cousin and me.  When this man kept interrupting us with comments that had nothing to do with the food or place, my cousin nicely said, \"Excuse me, we'd like to talk  privately.\"   He screamed obscenities at us and then threatened to turn down the a.c. \"so we would freeze.\"  We do have some pity for him, as he clearly doesn't seem mentally well, but we felt unsafe. He kept swearing about us as he returned to a table near the counter.  We told him and  his staff that we'll never  return.  We won't.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Always trying to find the ultimate Chinese restaurant in the Phoenix area so here I go again.  Good reviews on Yelp led me here so i was surprised that on a Saturday evening about 6PM, the restaurant was rather empty.  It's a clean restaurant with many tables and a few booths. \n",
      " \n",
      "We ordered Chinese broccoli with garlic sauce which we like much better than American broccoli, salt and pepper shrimp (spicy), chicken fried rice, and orange chicken without breading.  The food took a long time so I knew this would not be recycled food, LOL.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The broccoli was crisp and nicely flavored, but a little on the salty side.  I noticed the garlic were little tiny pebbles so I knew the garlic was not fresh, but rather out of a jar.  The chicken fried rice was plentiful and had generous pieces of chicken in it.  Unfortunately, the pieces of chicken were unseasoned and had no flavor.  The salt and pepper shrimp was a generous dish, 14 shrimp in all and perfectly cooked.  But this dish also lacked seasoning.  Needed more spiciness and salt.  The server said it was spicy so I assumed the spiciness would be discernible. The orange chicken dish was also generously portioned, sweet and nicely spiced.  \n",
      "Of all the dishes, I enjoyed the chinese broccoli the best.  The pricing is very moderate here giving you a good bang for the buck.  However, we were not impressed enough with the food to return with so many choices available especially in the Chandler area.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I just moved to Chandler and was happy to see the many asian restaurant choices in the area :)  I guess being in the vicinity of Le Le's market is a good thing.  I've ordered take out from this place twice in the last week....LOVE their food!  It reminds me of SF style...more unusual menu options (plus the regulars) with a ton of flavor and spice.  I would definitely reorder everything including:\n",
      "\n",
      "Shredded Pork w/ Garlic Sauce (delicious)\n",
      "Black Pepper Chicken w/ Scallions (fabulous)\n",
      "Black Pepper Beef Chow Mein (spicy!)\n",
      "Beef Chow Fun w/ Black Bean Sauce (big portion)\n",
      "Egg Rolls (perfectly crisp)\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Deep Fried Tofu Stuffed w/ Pork & Shrimp - a very unusual dish which I don't recall ever seeing on a chinese menu...FABULOUS!\n",
      "\n",
      "Chicken Chow Mein - Perfect!  One of the best I've ever had...perfectly seasoned, not too greasy, delicious chunks of chicken breast, scallions, onions and cabbage.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Even their white rice is amazing...delicious, light & fluffy :)\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I give this place 3.5. Definitely not as good as chinese food in CA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Me and my friends came here yesterday for a Chinese New Year dinner at around 6pm. It was quite busy already, which was expected since it was CNY. However, they were still able to sit us down right when we got in. I was really excited because when you see so many Chinese/ Asians there, you know this place is pretty decent and non-Americanized. \n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered:\n",
      "Wor Wonton Soup- it was good soup, but the meat in the Wontons didn't taste that fresh\n",
      "\n",
      "Chinese broccoli with hoisin sauce- Very good. Didn't overcook it, but this is something kinda hard to mess up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peking duck- AMAZING. The flavor of the duck was very good and the skin was crispy. Loved the shrimp chips at the bottom. The bread was good. It was hot and fresh. Also, it wasn't too sticky either. It had a nice texture. (FYI: don't expect to get a whole duck as the point of this dish is to put the crispy duck skin in the bread)\n",
      "\n",
      "Salted pepper fried fish- This dish wasn't as good as I expected. When I ate it, the fish was only lukewarm. The flavor was pretty good though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seafood and fried tofu hot pot- It had nice flavor and a lot of seafood and tofu. It would have been nice to have more vegetables though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peking Pork Chop: The sauce had a good flavor, but again the meat tasted old, not fresh, and lukewarm. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the best tasting dishes were the chinese broccoli and the peking duck. The service was slightly slow, but I gave them some slack because it was CNY and there were only 3 people working. I would have given this a 3, but since this was CNY and this is AZ, I lowered my standards a little and give them a 3.5.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Ordered some delivery from Tao Garden today via Doordash, and I can honestly say that it's a goddamned shame I haven't been here in so long. The shredded roast duck noodle soup is an absolute treat, with a really pleasant oily broth and nice chunks of tasty duck. The XO beef with green beans was wonderful, with a perfect texture contrasting between the crisp green beans and the softer but flavorful beef. The seafood with XO sauce was a winner, with large pieces of fresh seafood (fat scallops, chunks of squid, etc) with a little bit of spice to it via some stir-fried chilis. The Singapore style noodles were also amazing, with a nice little amount of spice that made you want to just suck in a mouthful and fill your cheeks with 'em.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, I'm really pleased with this place and I need to visit the actual restaurant again. I want to try some of that super-fresh fish!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] So, I don't want to stay this place discriminates against non Asians. .but it seemed that way. My family and I went for dinner. It wasn't busy, and I was meaning to try this place. After placing our order 2 Asian families came in and placed orders.Bad idea! In a hour of placing our order we only received the Egg Drop Soup an 32 minutes into the waiting for entrees. We then got egg rolls 45 mins in. Then finally after seeing all the Asian families get served food and talked to we left after no food at the hour and 15 min mark. Horrible Service. Poor customer service. It truly made me sad that we got discriminated against.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Great authentic Chinese food.  Very good price.  Very good portions. I would recommend this restaurant to friend and family over any other Chinese restaurant in Phoenix valley area.\n",

      "Great for Big parties too!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] The appetizers here are very good - both the crab puffs and the potstickers were solid.  The entrees are less so - the garlic chicken was okay but not great, the moo shu was meh. Huge chunks of veggies in the moo shu made it hard to eat, actually.  I also had the sizzling rice soup, which was pretty good though the broth could use a little more richness.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I went here with a large group. The service was good, although they did have to \"auction off\" the food. The server didn't have any problem keeping track of the separate checks, which was nice.\n",

      "The lunch specials are available on weekends, which is somewhat rare. It's an outstanding deal for $6.50. Mine included succulent sauteed shrimp with vegetables, an egg roll that was prepared perfectly, fried rice, and a cheese wonton.\n",

      "The quality of the food was good. The price was right. The service was good. With 32 lunch specials from which to choose, I'm sure we'll be back for more.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I was there a couple of years ago, walked in , sat dawn, got up and left. The reason was the attitude we got from the female waitress, felt like the owner. She was very rude and unfriendly. I just asked if they had different menu for Chinese customers, the woman threw the menu on the table and very loudly answered \"What Chinese menu? This is the menu!\" I got up and told my husband \"Let's go!\"\n",
      " This weekend, when my friend asked me to join them for dinner in this place, I firmly answered NO and asked her to reconsider. They went. She told me afterward that she really should have listened to me. They didn't get their water refilled and the owner complained about the 20 percent tip and said Chinese are cheap. Well. well. there are choices, don't spend money buying unpleasant experiences and bad attitude!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I would never come back to this restaurant again, the food is terrible and salty, especially their Thai Fried Rice it has raw egg smell and you have to pay extra if you want a to go cup.\n",

      "Didn't think anything was stellar and so many of the dishes paled in comparison to previous experiences.  I'm a big fan of chow fun. Just didn't really make an impression. We've also had great fried chicken & roast duck here in the past but they weren't executed well. \n",

      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] This is one of my favorite restaurants. I've been here with my friends a few times and I've never been disappointed. I would recommend trying their seafood soup and beef chow fun.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I have seen this place for years and I have always wanted to try it.  Today I stopped in with the kids and I am glad we did.  I had the teriyaki chicken with rice.  It has a lot of properly cooked vegetables and great flavor.  The kids had BBQ pork chow mein.  It had big soft noodles and the kids loved it and everyone commented on how great the rice was.  I have not been enjoying Chinese food lately so this was a great surprise.  The interior feels like a real restaurant too.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I've been craving for roasted duck and thought I had to drive all the way to the Chinese Culture Center in Phoenix, Tao Garden was only a block from where I live lol. Thank God . So we ordered half and stir fry fish so I thought it was fried ( my fault I didn't confirm it with the cashier) anyways for 19 bucks can't beat that price I used to pay close to 20$ in Phoenix for a half duck. The only thing I was a little unhappy was customers service a waitress(old lady with short hair) she just never smile and just gave me this rude look like I I owe her money I didn't appreciate that even when I smile at her just a staring look. Very rude. And they really need to learn how to speak with customers in a professional manner. The employee need to take English class to help with their speaking skill. Smile to your  customers really make us welcome there with a pleasant warm welcoming. I hate walking to most of the Chinese restaurants and they all look at you like you owe them money.\n",

      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I love this place! My wife and I have been coming here for years. It's our 'go to' for traditional Chinese food. My wife always orders Hot and Sour soup because she says it's the best she's had in the valley. I can't seem to get past their fish dishes because they're always fresh and delicious. The service is always good and the owner always comes over to say Hi. \n",
      "\n",
      "The last time we went on 1/21 we ordered the Hot and Sour soup, Vegetable Chow Mein, Home Style Fish Fillet, and hot tea.

      "Plenty of seating, alcohol license, big family tables with the lazy suzy in the middle ( I loves those tables ), and typical asian decor.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I ordered from here for the first time. I went in to look at the menu and place my take-out order. The staff was very friendly but you could tell they were overwhelmed by how busy they were. I placed my order and was told that the kitchen was backed up and that it would take about 40 mins for my order. I was ok with waiting,as it gave me an opportunity to go get my hair cut and come back. When I got back to the restaurant 40 mins later, it was like all hell broke loose. The people were running around like chickens with their heads cut off. There were customers in the dining room that looked just as hungry as they did when they I seen them 40 minutes ago and they still didn't have any food on the table. There were other takeout customers that called in and didn't seem happy that their orders were not ready. I knew that my order was probably also not ready and sure enough it wasn't.  The owner was in the dining room having dinner. He was a really nice guy and funny too. He went into the kitchen to check out what was going on and quickly came back out saying, \"it's all f$@ked up in there.\" I could only chuckle but I started to question if I made mistake ordering from here and began to worry that the food would not be good. 15 minutes later, my food was finally ready. I ordered general Tso chicken, Singapore rice noodle and egg rolls. They did mess up the Singapore rice noodles and gave me Singapore Chow mein but I didn't want to wait another hour for them to get it right, so I told them it was ok. I got my order an hour after i originally placed it. As I was walking out, I spoke with the owner. He said that he had surgery, so he can't help, he also said the best thing to do is call the order in and add 10 mins to the time they say it will be ready. I got home, again uncertain that the food would be good. To my surprise, the food was amazing. The best Chinese food I've found since moving to Arizona a few months ago. I'm giving this place a good rating, hoping that this was just a bad night for service; however, if it's business as usual, I'll take the owners advice and call ahead and add 10 mins to the pick up time. The food was worth the wait!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I ate here a few years ago and did not care for the food at all. So many folks who know Chinese food raved about it we went back the other day. My opinion of the place soared. We had a shrimp vermicelli dish in a clay pot that was fantastic. The mixed veg was just ordinary. The service was fine and the atmosphere vintage Oriental.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] It's hard to find authentic Chinese food but this is close enough. Their seafood soup was good and the salt and pepper shrimp is awesome. Their beef chow fun is legit. \n",

      "\n",
      "Let me tell you, we found a replacement. Tao Garden is the new spot. The food was absolutely delicious, every single dish. Hands down the best Chinese food we've had in years. If you're looking for a new, relatively inexpensive Chinese restaurant in Chandler, this is the place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only one negative: they failed to refill our drinks too much, but it was not a big deal compared to the deliciousness of the food. We will be going here for years to come.\n",

      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Love this place!  Best Chinese food in the area! I work in the area and love this place for lunch. They have great meal specials during the lunch hours and their food is made fresh and tastes great! They even make their crab puffs in house fresh!! A must try!! The owner is in often and very nice. This family owned restaurant is a hidden gem in Chandler!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Good food at reasonable prices.  They do not add MSG, but the food is still flavorful.  After being in China, if I want close to authentic, this is where I go.  I recommend the eggplant or string beans, plus the Kung Pao Shrimp is very good, perfectly spiced\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] This place is a joke. I ordered eggplant and chicken but had to pay an up charge of a $1 for the chicken. I get it back to my office just to have 7 small minced pieces of chicken in my dish! I wish I had taken a picture because it was unbelievable. I returned to the restaurant to show them and the lady at the register understand my frustration but the owner was yelling at me like a red headed step child. She said \"what do you expect for a dollar?!?!? I said CHICKEN! I told her I would've gladly paid more money for chicken but at least inform your customers a $1 doesn't get you chicken but literally a piece of chicken. All I wanted was chicken in my dish, is that too much to ask for?!??? The owner kept yelling at me with her mouth full, disgusting!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] We decided to try this place because of the good rating overall on yelp.  When we went in, we realized that we probably should have kept looking for another restaurant.  When you don't see any Asians in a Chinese restaurant on Saturday night, it gives you a pretty good idea as to what kinda food they serve.  Don't get me wrong though. We usually do like Americanized Chinese food.  But this place is not for us.\n",

The other evening we tried a \"new\" dish from them, something we have eaten in many other places - spicy eggplant with pork in black-bean sauce.  Lots of small narrow eggplant in a delicious sauce but the pork was difficult to find:(  We also ordered our favorite dish (from them)   Salt and pepper Squid!!!  No one makes it as good, no one.  Tons of deep fried breaded calamari with hot peppers and spices on a bed of shredded cabbage.  Tasty tasty tasty, tender tender tender, spicy spicy spicy!  Give them a try, you won't be sorry.  The place is clean, staff polite and efficient and have been there since I started eating there in 2006!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I came during rush hour for take out, was a 35 minute wait which I wasn't expecting with only one other couple waiting ahead of me, but the staff was friendly. The food was worth the wait!  incredibly fresh and delicious, great sauces. I got the mongolian beef and potstickers, and the portion was very generous for the price. The beef came with tons of onions which i love, and was surprisingly tender. I've been trying different places in the area and this is my favorite so far.\n",

      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Tried this place for lunch today after reading that the lunch specials are large and cheap.  The woman that greeted us was rude, the decor was fine, actually kind of nice for a Chinese place.  It looks like a TGIF, where all the crap was taken off the walls and replaced with Chinese lanterns and dragons.  I had the spicy garlic shrimp.  It wasn't spicy, it was sweet, the flavor was decent, but there were only FOUR shrimp!  Not even four big ones, four little guys.  The plate was almost entirely onions and peppers.  The crab Rangoon was good, and the eggroll was good.  The fried rice was just plain rice with some egg in it.  My wife tried the Eggplant rice plate which was pretty good.  I'm not planning on going back.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] So on the good ratings here, we decided to give Tao Garden a try. We're not Asian and from the midwest but my step-dad is Chinese and their family owns several Cantonese restaurants so I grew up with Cantonese-American food. I've been searching for food like what I'm used to here in Arizona and I'm afraid Tao Garden is another fail. I have no idea how the other Chinese people on here can think this is good food. Yeah, the taste was ok but the quality of the meat is disgusting. The chicken is spongy and tasteless--what part of the chicken is that? The neck? I'm used to white meat chicken chunks that actually look like chicken and not something scrapped off the underside of someone's shoe. I also tried the Sauteed Beef with Chinese broccoli on recommendations here and the Chinese broccoli itself was outstanding but the beef was low quality and rubbery. I used to get tenderloin in my food back home. The price is fair and the food has a good overall taste but I can't eat meat that's so spongy and squishy. Gross. I'd rather pay more to get better quality meat.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Sorry, I had to subtract because I came in here for lunch with a coworker.. we ordered at the same time.. his meal came out quickly.. mine did not. My plate came out about 10 minutes after his.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yesterday, I brought my roommate in for dinner. Again! his meal came out first, and mine was late! Only 5 minutes this time.. but still. Neither of our meals were anything special. I had the roasted duck. Menu say half duck.. I got part of a thigh, and more bones than meat on my plate. My buddy got a seared lamb dish which he said just did not taste good. Step Your Game Up Tao Garden.. I will be back to check on you for lunch someday-\n",

      "When I had last visited, there weren't very busy. It was a Sunday afternoon. We had ordered fried tofu, Mongolian beef, some kind of garlic chicken, fried rice, eggplant, and some other dishes. Each dish was very flavorful, and also presented well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, if you bring a large group there, and split the cost, you will get a lot of food for your  money. I believe that we had about 11 people, and possibly about 11 dishes.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Worst service ever.  Went in with my family at seven and the food never came.  We left at 7:57, the waitresses completely ignored us when we raised our hands.  Do not go here if you want to eat.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] my parents think this is the best chinese restaurant in town.  i'll give them that for the roast duck, which we order every single time.  clientele is mostly chinese, so read from that what you will. portions are big and good service.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Excellent food. Teriyaki chichen is not what you expect it's  better. Sliced  pieces of chicken with vegetables in the teriyaki sauce. My favorite beef chow fun. Both excellent dishes and they have the best Hot and sour soup.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] While I agree the male owner is a bit of a problem, the rest of the staff are always good to me.  Food is great, free of msg.  Price is also reasonable and cheaper than Phoenix Palace.\n",

      "\n",
      "Tao's food is great and for my Cantonese family we love the food here, which we give it a 5 star.  Now, does this compete well enough with the restaurants in San Francisco or Los Angeles, well, not quite, but it's as good as it gets here in the East Valley and it's reasonably priced, too, compared to the other Chinese Chinese restaurants. \n",
      "\n",
      "And, no I do not consider Panda Express, Pei Wei, PF Chang's or the like real Chinese.  So, for Chinese taste buds, Tao is good and where you see where there are mainly Chinese people frequenting the place, it really caters towards the Chinese taste buds, rather than Americans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything we get there is pretty good, which we get things like Honey Walnut Shrimp, various clay pots, pot stickers, Beef & Broccoli, steamed fish, Beijing Spare Ribs, Beef Chow Fun and then other dishes which I don't know the English names for (sorry).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the male owner of Tao sucks BIG TIME.  He is the rudest and most impolite owner I have ever met.  Whenever we come in and he's there, he is just an awful man and I don't know how his wife puts up with him.  I don't know if he's like that to all people or just to my family and I, but if there was another Cantonese restaurant nearby that served food just as well and the owners are good people, we'd stop going Tao ONLY because of how he treats us.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, Tao has been in business for quite awhile and they have a good following.  It is the Chinese restaurant that my family and I go to the most often.  \n",

      "The owner has cussed at us before, using profanity and for no good reason.  Like, the last time, we asked where we can sit.  He yells at us and curses us.  Seriously, is that a way to treat paying customers who order a lot?  \n",
      "\n",
      "When my stepdad died, we held the luncheon there and spent a lot of money providing lunch to all our guests.  I cannot tell you how much money we've spent there over the years, but it's a lot.  And when I say my family, it means my siblings and their families, my parents and other friends.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The male owner can be overhead by other customers on the phone to other people and just being rude to them, too.  He really could use a slap in the face of how poorly he treats other people.  His wife, however, is a very nice woman, and so are the other staff.  Too bad they have to put up with his abusive behavior.\n",

My personal favorite dishes are the Beef with Black Mushroom and Bamboo Shoots, Mushu Pork, and the Beef and Scallops. The average price on the dinner menu is probably $8.95.

Definitely recommend for some great take out chinese food but have to knock one star off for the dine in experience. The customer service is tereible. I waited for almost 15 minutes before someone came to take my order and after finally bringing my food i disnt see the waitress again until after my meal despite my empty glass of water. If the layout inside is also a little ragged and worn out looking.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] Pretty good little place to eat we usually get the sweet and sour chicken, egg rolls, & crab Angels I've tried other things but usually always order the usual stuff always pretty good too no complains.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] My family and I have been coming here for over 20 years. Their customer service is atrocious, but I have yet to have a better sizzling rice soup elsewhere. They have decent lunch specials, but they do charge for their over-watered drink refills. The sauces in their dishes are tasty, but the meat is questionable; it's chewy and perhaps a bit old. Overall an okay hole in the wall restaurant. \n",
      "\n",
      "Three stars for the overall quality and flavor of the food, they also serve your food very quickly. As for the customer service if I could give negative stars I would.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] As you read all the reviews yes, it is a whole in the wall.  Now that that is said, is there anything better? I've been getting take out from here since I was 9 years old with my parents (I'm 30 now).Same owners and recipes are the same.  Now I get to enjoy a traditional favorite that I enjoyed with grandparents to the table I share with my own kids.  I have been ordering the shrimp fried rice, which never disappoints. Husband orders the beef and broccoli and kids get the orange chicken.  Their crab puffs are delicious too. Try it, you won't regret.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] I used to love to eat here (and order take-out) when I worked on that side of town.  I've never had dinner there, but their lunch specials can't be beat!\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, it's kinda hard to find as it's, like, a little hole-in-the-wall dwarfed by a much larger Goodyear store; however it's much larger than it looks from the outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lunch menu has a number of different entrees to choose from, and while I have my favorites, they're all good.\n",
      "\n",
      "The portion sizes are huge!  Most of the lunch specials are served with fried rice (I don't really like their fried rice, so I'll usually order steamed with my lunch), egg drop soup with chicken, fried wontons (I think these actually have negative nutritional value), and an egg roll.  They do have a handful of selections that are served over steamed rice and when it's served to you, it's like this huge pile of deliciousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the food is made to order, it arrives at your table before you've had a chance to finish your soup - it's fresh and piping hot!\n",
      "\n",
      "I've had friends ask me to pick up some take-out for them when I'm on that side of town.  The most popular dish they ask me to bring back is Mongolian Beef, which is a huge portion of thinly sliced beef mixed with scads of green onions.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love the chicken with vegetables over rice.  The white sauce is light and doesn't overpower the veggies, which are cooked, but still retain a nice crispness.  If I'm feeling a little more oink-like, I'll opt for their sweet & sour chicken.  The pieces of chicken are lightly battered and deep fried, then topped with a light sweet & sour sauce.  I like this sauce because it's not too sweet and they don't add so much that the chicken is swimming in it and the breading absorbs it all - ick.  They top it off with large chunks of bell pepper, onions, carrots, and sweet pineapple.  Yumminess!\n",
      "\n",
      "While I don't eat fried wontons and I'm not crazy about egg rolls, their egg drop soup is one of the best I've had.\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple of things I don't like, though, are that their sodas don't come with free refills and if you order take-out, it doesn't come with soup.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Still, this place is definitely worth a try...\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] Will not come back...  this place has no windows? Decoration is outdated. Looks scary in there. Food, I didn't like.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] They have the best Chinese food in the valley, much better than PF. I always get their take out, but I do recommend dining in as everything is fresher. This place has been a family staple for a long time. So sad to see them go though (although not for some time). Hopefully they will open up somewhere else, when their lease is up. But until then get over there and get some good grub and spread the word!\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] Upon reading the Yelp reviews, I had to go here to see if indeed it's a scary place to dine. The restaurant itself has no windows, only the font door as form of outside light. As you come inside the restaurant, you can notice the minimum design on the walls and the never ending red carpet. The first dish, I ate was the hot and sour soup, the meat included in the soup was chewy and tasted old. I didn't eat much of it. As a parallel dish, the subgum shrimp tasted fresh, I liked the fresh vegetables in the dish. Overall, it's a typical Chinese American restaurant.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] Pretty good food. They don't deliver but the portions are huge! Nice people who run the place.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] I have no doubt that upon viewing the outside of Canton Dragon's building, many a customer has chosen to dine elsewhere. In fact, a couple of my friends are guilty of doing this! (The appearance on the inside isn't much better.) But don't let its appearance fool you. Yes, it is tiny. Yes, it looks uninviting. Yes, if I were the owner I would have relocated a long time ago or at least invested in some massive renovation! However, the inside is clean, and their food is delicious!\n",
      "\n",
      "Canton Dragon has been a family favorite for many years. They have an excellent selection of entrees to choose from, their lunch prices are fantastic, and the food portions are just right.\n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite dish is their Sweet and Sour Chicken. I also love their rice. However, I'm not a fan of their eggrolls. During my last visit, I tried their Orange Chicken for the first time. It was tasty, however, I still like their Sweet and Sour Chicken better.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're looking for a new place to get some good Chinese food, I highly recommend giving Canton Dragon a try.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] Been a family favorite since i can remember..Best egg drop soup ever as well as best fried rice and sweet and sour chicken..better the panda..this food taste and smells as if it were made homemade...try it out its affordable and taste so good!!\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] Really good food for the price. Staff is always smiling and very courteous!\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] Looks scary from the outside, but it is good! I take out way more than I dine in. Every time I order take out, no matter how much I order, it always takes \"about ten minute\" :-)\n",
      "\n",
      "The fried rice is the best around, not greasy, just delicious!! I personally like the pork or combo fried rice the best. Huge portion! \n",
      "\n",
      "Other faves are happy family, hot and spicy shrimp, and tung-ting shrimp.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] I love this place\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Food is always delicious.  If you come before 4 you can get their lunch specials.  Im in love with their Orange chicken, pork lo mein, showfun and their soup. Everything on their menu is tasty. the waitresses have been here for years they are very fast and friendly.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] I'd been coming to this place for many years.  \n",
      "Food is the best in town no doubt!! \n",
      "Restaurant it self definitely needs a fixer upper.  But u can over look that once u try their food. My favorite dishes are Orange Chicken and Pork fried rice. But Crab Puffs are the best.  No other restaurant makes them as good.  Lunch time it's the best time to eat here since they serve u combos of ur favorite dishes that include egg drop soup, fried rice, egg roll and a main dish.  But u can definitely feed two out of each combo meal.  Eating in or taking out meals are always freshly made to order and favors are consistent.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] Big servings ..owner came around and ensured everyone was doing good which is not like most Asian places ...it's ghetto yes in the ghetto yes but it's traditional Chinese family style eating with huge one plate per item servings ..Good food\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] There is no other choice when it.comes to Chinese food. I and my family have been coming here for 17 years and there food is the same as it was from day one. The restaurant is family owned and they truely love owning this restaurant. I have tried almost everything on this menu and can never say the dish wasn't delish! Every person I have brought here over the years have made this a regular spot of choice. I have even moved very far from from the restaurant and still will call in the order and carry it out on my way home. Best egg drop I have ever had. If you love authentic Chinese food then this is the place to come hands down. Don't let the exterior fool you its a hidden gem!!!!\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] Best Chinese food in Glendale And the service is great I always order carry out and it's ready within 10min of placing my order. Food taste great and price is right.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] Awesome doesn't even begin to describe this place! Don't let the exterior deter you from the amazing food and the ridiculously large portions. Our server could barely speak English but it only made the experience more authentic. Even if this were in SF's China Town, it would be my #1 choice!\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] If you go for the food you will love it. The restaurant is a little plain and old looking but the food is amazing, service is great and portions are huge. Great food and great price!\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] My family has been going here for years.  They have updated the exterior. But it is still plain exterior no windows nothing to look at.  BUT THE FOOD is GREAT, the prices are decent too.  I judge a Chinese restaurant on its egg drop soup, egg rolls ( not spring rolls) pops plate, moo goo gai pan (sp) chow mein, Mongolian beef, and beef mushu.  And this restaurant hits all those dishes with Top marks. \n",
      "Sometimes the egg rolls can be a little greasy,  and the chicken ones are better in my opinion... But the rest of my family like the regular ones.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] I've been going here for 20 years. Egg drop soup and hot and sour soup are very good. All their fried food is good. Sweet and Sour pork is my favorite. Their fried rice is great. Only dish we didn't care for are Kung Pow chicken. I love their chicken and veggies over rice lunch. They have the best lunch specials. No refills on soda is a bummer. Sweet and sour pork, fried rice, 2 fried wontons, egg roll, and egg drop soup for $5.50 is hard to beat at lunch.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] This is such a small hole in the wall place, but when I was living in DC for a while, I missed this place tons. They absolutely have the best Kung Pao ever! Not that spicy, and a lot of food for a cheap price! If you like Kung Pao, like a lot of good food for little price, this is the chinese food place to go! \n",
      "\n",
      "Not much of an atmosphere, would suggest taking it home to eat. The \"mother\" that will most likely be checking you out, has been there for years!\n",
      "\n",
      "I am getting hungry thinking of their Kung Pao.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] This is a step above what I was expecting.  The food is consistent.  The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Great place for family dining.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] Give this place a shot. Yes it looks scary and the inside is about as scary as the outside, but good food comes from places that look like this... All the love and money goes to the food, they don't get caught up in painting, updating or remodeling. It shows too because the food is awesome.\n",
      "\n",
      "When my family comes from out of town, this is one of the places that's placed on the itinerary to eat at. \n",
      "\n",
      "Don't miss out on this place because it looks scary.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] The place looks like a dive and as we all know, sometimes that is the kind of place that has the best food. If you are a fan of Hot-N-Sour soup, your quest for the best ends here. Order a bowl of it, they make it to order and  it borders on sinful! Wish I could give it 6 stars.....\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] This place is great. Friendly low key atmosphere. I have been coming here for years and almost always order the Orange Chicken. In my opinion it's the best in town.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] Best Chinese in the area fast friendly service and delicious and very economical and you get your moneys worth here I go there a lot never have I been dissatisfied in any aspect . the ladies there are so nice to every customer and the food is just amazing :) I hope this place stays around for a long time ! If they would update the appeance of the place I think people would be more attracted to try it they have no idea what they're missing I'm glad I gave it a shot I don't regret it :)\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] I used to really love this place. It has been open for years so that says a lot about them. However, the last few times I have eaten there, I have gotten sick. I think they leave their meat out. The last few times I have eaten the shrimp fried rice, it tasted like it was rotten, but that they used it anyway.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] Love this place great service, large portions . The food was on point! My new go to spot.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] Straight up and down... I'm 32 years old and I've been eating at this place since I was probably 8 or 9 years old. Some of the same ladies that absolutely run this place, are still there. Yes, the place is a dive in terms of appearance but if you are looking for something pretty, then go eat some wack snowbird food at some Chinese \"Bistro\" and enjoy sucking at life. Canton Dragon has authentic Chinese offerings, as well as Americanized entrees that have become staples amongst the average diner. As a kid, I didn't know the difference between traditional Cantonese or Szechuan cooking, so I formed my favorites with an unfamiliar tongue. General Tso's Chicken is a pretty americanized dish, but I promise you... this place makes the golden standard as far as I'm concerned. I measure every single plate of General Tso that I encounter, based on my experience at Canton Dragon and not a single one from here, to NY and in between can come close. It's just basic chicken fritters, battered and fried, served with lots of onions in a sweet and spicy, chili garlic sauce. The batter, and also the bed of onions, NOT BROCCOLI, is where the success lies. Must try... They also have the best Egg Rolls I've ever had. Ask for house chinese mustard on the side... The Szechuan Beef is another staple on my table at Canton Dragon... Julienne chopped veggies and thinly slices beef in an incredible savory and spicy sauce. I often ask for it extra spicy but I am a fire eater, so I plan on asking for chili sauce or oil to use as well. If it ain't hot enough... ask for some friggin hot sauce... Lastly, their egg drop soup is a tremendous cure for a gnarly hangover. This place is a gem in the AZ desert. Running strong for MANY years... Do yourself the favor. \n",
      "\n",
      " Oh, and if you are a snowbird putz, then you can try their PV/Scottsdale Location and pay the same price for smaller portions, made ALMOST as well as the OG. It get's props because it's owned by the same family though!!!!.\n",
      "\n",
      "Support AZ business, and buy local!\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] I am not a Chinese expert by any means but I thought this was a really good lunch spot. Sketchy looking for sure, but fast, friendly service and the food was really good. I had the moo goo gai pan lunch special. All the veggies were really fresh. Chicken, of course, looked questionable but I've never had Chinese food with \"good\" chicken. Fried rice was good although no eggs or veggies in it. Egg drop soup very salty but good and the egg roll was crispy. All for $6. I'll definitely be back.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] First time here and will probably be my last. The food was alright. More like meh. I ordered the teriyaki chicken and it was a little bland. My boyfriend ordered salt and pepper shrimp and he really liked it. \n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant isn't as scary as everyone thought but the decor is very simple like all white walls and yes there are no windows. The waitress took our order and only came back to ask if we needed a box and then left us a check. Also, a beetle just flew onto the table.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] This is by far my favorite Chinese food place but then again I'm a little bit biased because I've been coming to this place since I was 3 years old and I'm now 26 years old. My dad is a retired Phoenix police officer and him and his friends used to eat here all the time since the place opened. Yes it does need a lot of updating on the inside there are no windows it may look wrong but it's a great place with great food and they give you a lot of food.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] Came here on my way home in a hurry to feed my family. Ordered food to go which didn't take long. The food was really good we had ordered pork fried rice, happy family,  chow fun, and sweet and sour chicken all were delicious just like my favorite restaurant. Definitely coming back.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] Orange chicken and Lo Mein are exquisite! I come from Lynwood, California where the Chinese food is pretty darn good. This is the closest I can get to that. I love their crab angels because they don't skimp on the yummy cream cheese!!  \n",
      "\n",
      "I love coming here for lunch because you get the most bang out of your buck. Don't miss out on this lovely restaurant.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] This place has been a favorite for years! Popo platter for the appetizer and general tso lo mein for the plate.  This place has the best egg rolls I've ever had at any Chinese restaurant.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] Don't be fooled by the low prices. The food was pretty good and the servings are HUGE! Each serving could easily feed two. My only complaint is that I asked them to make my meal \"extra spicy\" and it wasn't spicy at all. I would definitely go back.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] So I've been coming here for over 10 years and I finally decided to write a review. I have so many good things to say about Canton Dragon I've tried just about everything on the menu and loved all of it. When I think good chinese food I think of this place. Good tasting food in big portions and small prices. The staff is always the same because its a family ran restaurant   and sometimes they could be a little rude but I'm so used to it I think its funny. I go out of my way to eat there.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food', 'Sandwiches', 'Bistros', 'Restaurants'] A lovely family run cafe/bistro at Tollcross. On my first visit I had a coffee which was better than avarage and then went back to try their lunch. Had their famous macaronni cheese. It tasted wonderful and was a very large portion! So much so that I ended up taking some home with me for my evening meal :-)\n",
      "There is a seperate weekend menu to the weekday one. Recommended when you are in the mood for a nice large comfort meal well prepared and served with care. I would also try the muffins  baked fresh each day they are what a muffin ought to be! Full of flavour and crumble as you eat.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food', 'Sandwiches', 'Bistros', 'Restaurants'] Located on Tollcross, Two Thin Laddies is a bit of a disappointment. Maybe my experience of it was like when you go see a film that's been ranted and raved about so much that you're expecting cordon bleu and you get a glorified greasy spoon, or in cinema terms, you're expecting Scorsese and you get Love, Actually. That's not to mean it's not satisfying, but I came out with a very disappointing taste in my mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went out of my way to go there for breakfast because I had to wait a couple of hours before being attended at the GUM clinic. My main disappointment was that if you go somewhere for breakfast and order a poached egg, you kind of expect it to actually be poached and not just cracked and boiled and overdone in water. But my egg was definitely the latter. On a redeeming note, the person I went there with said the sausages were actually quite good, and I'm guessing, not overdone. \n",
      "\n",
      "This isn't to say that Two Thin Laddies is terrible. It does decent food, but when somewhere's been talked up so much, it'll almost inevitably be a disappoint. I may as well have paid less and gone to Snax that morning.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food', 'Sandwiches', 'Bistros', 'Restaurants'] Only food I have eaten here has been the \"all day breakfast\" at the weekend but that has been excellent! The only negative is the toast, it's a little but underdone for my taste but it does come buttered so you are not faffing about with butter/spread portions lol.\n",
      "The service can be a bit slow at times but all the food is freshly prepared to order so it's not too big an issue...however, the staff are polite and friendly and do bother to come back and ask if everything is okay after you have started (without leaving it too late).\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food', 'Sandwiches', 'Bistros', 'Restaurants'] This place keeps changing owners, so I thought I'd give it another shot.  Saying that it's even worse than before is a bit of an understatement.  Service was non existent, they didn't have most of the things on the menu, latte was more like a warm milk. \n",
      "There are far better coffee shops in Tollcross.  Won't be going back.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food', 'Sandwiches', 'Bistros', 'Restaurants'] From the look of Two Thin Laddies, and the pun in the name, I had a feeling this place was going to be one of these fancy, teeny tiny portioned places with humorous quips on the menu. It wasn't at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best way to describe this place is a bistro, serving good, homely and tasty grub which is about as un-pretentious as you could get.\n",
      "\n",
      "They serve things like Mac and cheese, salads, paninis and baked tatties, all of which are served in big portions, ample enough to fill even the hungriest tums. I had a cheese and ham panini with a humungous side salad which was delicious. \n",
      "\n",
      "The greatest thing about this place is the tray bakes, the sort of cakes your mum or granny make, and the millionaire's shortbread I had with a cup of tea was literally heavenly! Best I have tasted in a long time, maybe even ever! (Don't tell my mum I said that!)\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food', 'Sandwiches', 'Bistros', 'Restaurants'] The excellent roasted vegetable soup was the highlight of our visit to Two Thin Laddies. It really was profoundly satisfying. The place is quirky, too, so I can see myself popping back, from time to time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, we said: \"Two Thin Laddies served us pretty nicely. The soup was really good, while the main courses were decent. I'd happily come back, though I may favour it as a soup stop, solely. For generously portioned, healthy fare, it seemed like a reliable place, to me.\"\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food', 'Sandwiches', 'Bistros', 'Restaurants'] Unfortunately I have not had good experiences at Two Thin Laddies. I have been here several times for both food and coffee. Just the other day I stopped in for a mocha for takeaway and it was the worst coffee I've had in a long time. The service wasn't good (I was standing at the counter without any acknowledgement from the staff and then he didn't know how to make the mocha once I'd ordered). The food is basic and has no presentation to it at all. Even though it is handily open early in the morning I'll be skipping it from now on. Its a shame because I had heard good things about it in the past.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food'] this location is awesome, great location, great staff, and awesome options for a starbucks, Always a great experience coming here, even if its for the simplest item, or the most complicated order, this location is a master of its craft. \n",
      "always clean, never busy, parking is hit or miss, but excellent transit options.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food'] I thought I would really like this Starbucks. It looks awesome from the outside. It used to be an old bank, and it's location is right at the intersection of Bloor and Dundas, but the interior isn't anything special. There are just a few tables and chairs on one side of the cafe. The chairs aren't that comfortable and the tables are very close together. There are a few patio chairs outside in the summer, but currently Roncesvalles is being torn up, so sitting outdoors isn't that appealing!\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food'] Worthy of 5 stars?  Definitely. Why?  Because, as most Starbucks go - the quality and products are quite consistent.  What separates this one from others?  Came in here during the Polish festival, and it was *packed*.  But somehow, with the number of customers in there and no more staff than any other Starbucks, they processed everyone *fast*.  I think I had around 15-20 people in line ahead of me, and I had ordered and was out with my order is around 5 minutes.  That's impressive - well done guys.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food'] I walked in and there was a homeless man napping at one of the tables.  The staff was nowhere to be seen - they were hanging out by the fridges in back.  When one of the barristas finally came to the front, I explained that I was hoping to get some work done and asked if they could turn down the uncharacteristically blaring music.  They acknowledged it was really loud but said the only other option would be to turn it off which seemed like a really reasonable option but they said Starbucks doesn't let them do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, a super unpleasant Starbucks experience.  Truly, they have become the McDonalds of coffee.  Managed to find Coffee and All That Jazz around the corner and the difference was striking.  Chill vibe, friendly staff, and comfortable interior.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Protip: Skip the corporate bullshit and support your local businesses.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food'] Probably my favourite Starbucks in the world. The staff is always having a good time, serving bless drinks, and hookin it up phat for the fam. This establishment is a pillar of the community.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food'] One of the best macchiatos I've had here (5 shot, lactose free, extra hot, light foam, sugar free...so I'm that annoying customer, but it was perfect) \n",
      "\n",
      "A little slower sometimes, but if there's anything you don't like about your drink the won't hesitate to take it back and remake it (true to sbux code!!) \n",
      "\n",
      "Never super busy, and lots of places to sit (though no super cozy sofas...these seem to all be gone)\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food'] Pretty decent coffee. I'm not a huge coffee fan so I'm the one to grab an icy blended drink like the Green Tea Frappuccino or the incredible Teavana drinks (this is where Starbucks gets some extra stars from me).\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Coffee & Tea', 'Food'] This Starbucks is always very clean, the cafe itself, as well as the washrooms. Baristas always seem to be friendly and chatty, and I've never encountered someone who was grumpy, pissy, or a chore to deal with. I can't say this is typical of the establishment; I may just have amazing luck whenever I go.\n",
      "\n",
      "This old bank, situated just south of Bloor St, where Dundas and Roncesvalles split, has a good amount of seating. There are two tables to the right (upon entering), near the table with all the coffee accessories on it (milk, cream, etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "To the left, there are four comfy chairs with a dividing wall, the other side of which has more tables and chairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have a very nice patio, with plenty of room for you to enjoy a coffee while reading, working, or even playing games on your laptop.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only issue with this Starbucks, and it's not the fault of the business itself, is that because of it's close proximity to the Dundas West subway station (a less than two minute walk), is it's often very busy. The line always moves quick, but if you're looking for a place to sit, you may have issues. It isn't as bad during the warmer months, as people will be sitting on the patio, or just standing around outside.\n",

      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Seafood', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers'] It was my birthday so I enjoyed my free birthday meal. The shrimp burrito was wonderful. I always enjoy the chips and salsa bar - everything is so fresh and yummy! Service with a smile and the place is pretty clean.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Seafood', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers'] Service is fantastic, always friendly.  I love the grilled veggie burro, and also the portabello and poblano taco!  My son loves the cheese quasadilla kids meal, it's sort of rolled like a cheesy burro which makes it easy for him to manage.  On our most recent trip my mom tried the grilled grande bowl and really enjoyed it, she said it was perfect for summer, not as heavy as a burro but very yummy.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Seafood', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers'] First time stop for us.  \n",

      "No, it is not fine dining.  \n",

      "\n",
      "The food was tasting, the missus had the shrimp tacos and I ahd a combination plate of shrimp burrito and fish tacos.  I am not a huge fan of rice and beans in my burrito and so was a bit disappointed by the quantity of the rice and beans in burrito, but that was my fault.\n",

      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Seafood', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers'] I sure missed me some Rubio's while living in Texas for the past 4 years!\n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant chain as a whole is one of my favorites, but this location is just not up to par. I'm rating based on multiple visits, all having a consistent \"meh\" experience. I have zero issues with the food. It's still the delicious Rubio's that I expect. My office is walking distance away; I would love to come here more often, but just can't bring myself to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The entrance leaves only enough room for 2-3 people to stand in line to order. And stand in line you will! Every time I have come here was during the lunch rush, and not once was there more than one person taking orders. You're forced to either block the entrance/exit or take the line outside (which is not desirable in the heat of the summer). Once you do finally reach the counter to place your order, consider yourself lucky if the employee even looks at you. Not once in 5+ times has anybody smiled and greeted me here, which I had come accustomed to when I worked over by the location on Tatum & Bell (5+ years ago). I have also never found an empty table that didn't require me grabbing a bunch of napkins to clean up so I can sit down.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know if complaints have been rolling in, but my most recent visit was a little better. Tables still had some mess, but not nearly as bad. And the guy that brought me my food actually smiled and asked if I needed anything else.\n",

      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Seafood', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers'] The staff is fantastic compared to how they were last year. Now they seem a lot more engaged and get your food out fast. If you go please try the coastal trio it's amazing and their fish tacos are some of the best! I enjoy trying the new burritos they put out!\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Seafood', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers'] I walk in to this location to grab some lunch with my husband. We did not get a Hi, Hello, I'll take your order when we first walked in. The blonde girl at the counter could not take to time to look up at us. After I ordered my Tacos my husband proceeded to order his food. The cashier said \"hold on I have to add all these details to all three tacos\". As if that was a huge problem for her. The manager came to the second register and yelled ill take whoever is next. Overall just poor customer service throughout my whole experience\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Seafood', 'Restaurants', 'Caterers'] I stopped in because I never tried a fish taco. I ended up buying the Cabo Platter, a fish taco and a shrimp burrito. The Fish Taco's breading was way overcooked to the point of burned - I couldn't taste or feel the texture of the fish my first two bites. The Shrimp Burrito was delicious.  While I would go back again I'd probably avoid another fish taco as a result of this. Overall, it was a good eating experience and I would return.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Food', 'Coffee & Tea'] It's Saturday morning on Sept. 24th/16. I'm getting my vehicle serviced across the street at VW Yorkdale. So I walk over to grab a coffee and muffin. Service was good and quick. The decor looked really nice and relaxing. The problem began when I sat down to enjoy an enjoyable coffee house experience. Tables were yet to be cleaned...What I got was three girls behind the counter (maybe two, might be unfair to the one that who took my order) talking loudly about getting 'hammered' the night before and throwing around f bombs in front of the patronage. I get that there should be cameraderie amongst co workers. It makes the day go by quickly and you enjoy your job. I used to be a barista at Starbucks myself. I know how unnerving the morning rush can be. But, not at the expense of the customer experience. Cackling of laughter, gossip about the night before involving alcohol, puking and getting 'hammered' is not what customers want to hear. You might be thinking 'just mind your business' or 'go somewhere else'. Kind of difficult when they are speaking loudly and throwing f bombs around. And yes, I will be going elsewhere. Never thought I'd be the 'get off my lawn' and 'turn the music down' guy as I'm pretty liberal, but this experience has turned me into one.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Food', 'Coffee & Tea'] Great lattes..great service. This location is nicer than some of their other places. The couches are a nice touch but rarely has time to stay. But there are always people utilizing the space. Washroom pretty clean as well.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Food', 'Coffee & Tea'] This is more of a bar-style Second Cup, like the one on Leslie north of York Mills. Warm and cozy in the winter. You can't walk to it, unless you're up for some exercise. It's nestled in the parking lot between the Costco and the Liquor Store and is much more car friendly than pedestrian friendly, but that goes for much of Downsview.\n",
      "\n",
      "The coffee and food are standard for the chain--decent and for some reason more expensive than Starbucks.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Food', 'Coffee & Tea'] Free wifi, good coffee, alot of space and room to meet, study, hang out and drink coffee. From the tables to chairs and outlets, I would see this location as good study spot.... not hard to find but it just north of yorkdale but i dont see this plaza seeing as much attention with yorkdale right there.  It is queit, the coffee is good. I could probably spend hours here and might if Im not kicked out.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Food', 'Coffee & Tea'] This seems to be my GO TO place when meeting some of my friends that live out west near the airport and Yorkdale area.  Due to its central location right off the Allen road, and highway its not a surprise that this place is usually busy with its regular clientele.  There's an abundance of parking available, and the venue is very clean, presentable with no shortage of seating.  Most Second Cup locations are relatively built the same, with the same layout, but the spaciousness, to me that is, is very important.  I dislike coming to a coffee joint where space is premium...much like the real estate in Toronto lol.  The service is great, and the workers are awesome in a personable way to both the regulars and non regular clientele.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Food', 'Coffee & Tea'] As Second Cup is a franchise, it's always hit or miss. This location on Wilson was definitely the former.\n",
      "\n",
      "Came here tonight (Tues) with some work colleagues. Considering the time, it was pretty busy with people of all different ages. There were a few people with laptops open; I'm assuming they were university students doing their work. We had to wait a few minutes for four chairs to open up, but during the wait time, we were able to order our drinks and food. There are many places to sit - from the stools to the big comfortable chairs. It's the perfect place to get school work done or meet up with friends. There are a lot of pastries and sandwiches to choose from. Depending on the franchise location, I find that this can differ from store to store. I ordered the vanilla bean latte and was not disappointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't live anywhere close to the area so I doubt that I'll be sitting here sipping a latte anytime soon, but if I'm in the area I'll be back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yay, I'm a fan.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Food', 'Coffee & Tea'] Great open space. Couches and tables. High ceilings. The crowd isnt all students, but great for work (outlets are ample) and good for just a chat. \n",
      "\n",
      "My only complaint is that the tables I am sitting at right now are too high vs that chair. My shoulders hurt. \n",

      "The floor is also quite dirty and I really don't want to put anything there. Needs a sweep. Crumbs everywhere. \n",
      "\n",
      "I do like how the treats, they have many all natural and gluten free options. I've actually always been a fan of Second Cup treats as opposed to you know, the other one. Also La Rocca cake slices are available if you want to indulge even more. \n",
      "\n",
      "Free wifi, but they want you to sign up with Facebook (and give access to your information), a sign up form, or a credit card (but it's free!)\n",
      "\n",
      "Great place to kill some time and be productive between activities.\n",

      "\n",
      "The music that plays here is almost always Spanish music -  this could be con depending on how you're feeling.  \n",

      "\n",
      "My drinks are usually very good, just the way I like it, but today I decided to go with a plain old iced coffee with a shot of vanilla, sweetened with milk..  When I got it, it looked watered down and  barely had milk in it.  Took a sip and it was like water with a hint of coffee.  No vanilla taste.  I ended up scooping ice out,  adding milk and sugar to my liking.  It's too bad.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Had the supreme pizza and a Stromboli. Not sure what the Stromboli was, maybe I'm just not used to there being onions and peppers in a Stromboli. It also had too much cheese compared to what I'm used to. Least favorite Stromboli I've ever had. The pizza supreme was average at best. Papa johns would've been better.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I go here all the time, and I love their pizza. The reason why they get 3 stars is the service. They are so slowwwwwww. I don't get it. I usually order for pick up, and how is it that 25-30 mins later I arrive and my pizza order is not done. It's a regular cheese pizza not a full blown 3 course meal that I am ordering. Also when your ordering over the phone it's like the person taking the order is always spaced out.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Not bad. A slice & a soda will set you back about $7.50. Higher than most places, but it is Summerlin. Slices are a little larger than if you go to a pizzeria & order 2 slices. Very small inside dining area.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Stopped by 30 minutes before close and got a slice of pepperoni. I swear frozen pizza at Albertson's tastes better than this. Also there were only 5 pieces of pepperoni. Pizza Hut tastes better than this...\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] New York style pizza. They sell the whole pie or by the slice. \n",
      "\n",
      "The crust is soft but yet had just the right amount of crunch. The pepperoni could've had a little more crisp to it and didn't have much flavor.  The cheese was melted just right and was pretty good. I'd add just slightly more red sauce to each slice. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it's a decent slice of pizza to pick up along the way of your shopping at the mall.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] My boyfriend and his family were at the outdoor mall doing some day after xmas shopping. We were starving and it was freezing, so we didn't want to walk to the other side of the mall towards more of the restaurant area. We decided to go to Bonanno's NY Pizzeria. We had about 7 of us, and this place was pretty small inside and packed, so we ended up sitting outside under the heated lamps so we could have some space.\n",
      "\n",
      "The garlic knots were super good! The tomato basil and red onion pizza was pretty flavorful, too! Overall it was a great deal and the staff was friendly. They even recommended us getting a full pizza instead of slices since it would be cheaper, which I thought was nice that they recommended. We ended up just doing the slices since they were already there. \n",
      "\n",
      "This place is great for a quick bite to eat!\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] This place is SO good. Fresh food, their garlic knots are delicious!! Service was great, will definitely be back!\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] 3-13 was yet another day of stopping in to get my pizza fix. I always come here around the same time and I get my Stuffed pizza fix. The last 4 times I have come they are out. They don't even have at least a thick crust pizza option for those of us that like it. I still grabbed a Hawaiian slice. Little did I see some of the peppers from the supreme set above my Hawaiian had fallen on my pizza. I hate peppers. At least I'm not allergic. \n",
      "The young man at the register was a delight. He even asked the chefs why they never have the stiff d pizza anymore. Their response was something left to be desired. They said they only make it once a day in the am because it takes so much to do. Lame answer for a lazy chef if you ask me. Then make two so it lasts. If you're constantly selling out...... then make more  but whatever. I have like I said come 4 times now for the best stuffed pizza ever, but I have no reason to come back. If it's always gonna be gone because it's too much work then what's the point\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Not much to say. Had a whole supreme and also a slice of cheese. Both were greasy. The sausage were thickly sliced and was bland. Crust was thin which made it soggy. Overall flavor was so-so. No bathrooms in establishment for patrons that I could see. Small joint so it did have the feel of a neighborhood pizza place in NY. Not my kind of pizza that I like though.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] It was ok, the sauce needed more garlic, thin crust was nice, but overall wasn't impressed... You think for summerlin it might be better... i wont be back,\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Right from when you come in, you can tell this employees  love their job. Offer great customer service very attentive. Good was so delicious, the garlic knots I personally would give them a 10. Pizza, you can choose from a slice to a whole pizza. A must stop if your shopping at downtown summerlin\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Bonano's Bew York Pizza is my absolute favorite. I come here everytime I come to Vegas. There is no better pizza. I don't care how fancy or not, what region- Italian or frozen. There is nothing that sings to my taste buds as beautifully. Lol!\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Very good NY style Italian Food & Pizza...outdoor patio & bar tables...delicious garlic knots on the table along with a mini antipasto...we shared a Margarita pizza, Chicken Parmagian & Penne ALa Vodka\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Pizza was good, the girl (cashier) was super snotty. 3 slices and 2 waters 17 bucks a bit steep- but the slices were filling,  but fresh, not greasy -a nice place to.people watch\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] The pizza was good.  However the Caesar was wilted.   Also the tables and floor was dirty.  We ate there and for 30 minutes the people working talked and walked around but did not clean.  Maybe because it was late.  1 hour before closing.  But the pizza is not that incredible to ignore the dirt.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] The pizza is usually very good. For some reason it was not up to the standards they've set. But today the selection was not up to par & my fiancé was looking forward to their stuffed pizza, and they did not offer it. This is the 3rd or 4th time this has been the case.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Fast, consistent, and delicious. \n",
      "\n",
      "The pizzas are sitting under a heat lamp but when you order theyll grab your slice and pop it in the oven for a minute or two. This makes the cheese nice and gooey and the crust crunchy. Yum.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] When we first started going here we were so happy to find a pizza place that was close to REAL NY pizza.  The past two times we've been really disappointed. Don't know if they changed the flour or started using \"Vegas\" water but the change is noticeable. We are going to give it one more shot somewhere in the near future & if it hasn't improved we will NOT re\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Pizza is delicious. Service is great especially Rick. Great atmosphere. Garlic knots are delicious too. Will definitely be back\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Idk what everyone is talking about.  This pizza is really high quality and made very well. \n",
      "Is the price good? Not really.  But, if you want a high end quality pizza then this is a good place for that.\n",
      "Remember,  if you leave a bad review you might end up sleeping with the fishes or possibly waking up with a horse head in your bed.\n",
      "Is the pizza here good? ??\n",
      "Forgettah bout it....\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] My wife and I went to Summerlin because we had never been there, and she wanted to shop.  We started to get hungry, and being from New York, and she is Italian, looked for a pizza place. When we saw Bonanno's we thought we would give it a try.  Well, she ordered a couple of plain slices, and I got the ham stromboli, and let me tell you, this was the best Italian meal we have had, outside our house.  Not for nothing, but you know when the grease is dripping on the plate that it's fresh, and the gravy (sauce) has chunks of sliced garlic, it's just the right amount.  We ate outside, and when done, I went in to tell them it was damn good, and the chef was there, a nice guy!  I'd go back to Summerlin just for this joint, forget the shopping.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] BEST pizza in town!  I'm from NJ and it's just like back home. I've lived in Las Vegas for 22 years and it took that long for someone to realize that, for those of us that moved here from the East Coast, miss our pizza. Thank you.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] The kids and I passed by and couldn't help but notice how amazing it smelled. Had to stop in and grab the kids and I a few slices. Definitely recommend\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Let me start off by saying that the pizza is actually good. But totally not worth it because of the headache you get dealing with the staff at this location. I've encountered some of the rudest people on the phone. When I've ordered take out my pizza would be either cold (I'm assuming I'm getting an old pie) or not even in the oven. Again the pizza is good but dealing with the hit or miss (more miss then hit) type of service I'd say pass, save yourself the the head ache and go to another place.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Great flavor on the chicken bbq, it needs more chicken on it though, but was a great slice!  The garlic knots need more garlic, they are butter soaked but just tastes like bread with a little butter flavor over all great experience less then $10 for a meal for 1 person. I will be back!\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] This is a mediocre pizza place that thinks it's high class. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's basic pizza, nothing impressive for the cost. Garlic knots should just be called bread. Zero garlic flavoring. I'm not sure I'd put it above Pizza Hut or any over generic delivery place. \n",
      "\n",
      "What completely baffles me about this place is that they have the nerve to charge $6 for a bottle of water. Not a giant bottle. Just your standard size.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I must say the buffalo chicken pizza is deliciously. I was a little upset that they didn't have any ranch salad dressing.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] We got a slice of pepperoni, cheese and the stuffed spinach and broccoli pizza. The pizza was okay but the stuffed pizza was amazing. Packed full of flavor and very filling.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Convenient and shockingly good pizza!\n",
      "\n",
      "When shopping you're normally looking for something quick and this fits the bill!\n",
      "\n",
      "Been here a dozen times and will continue the trend\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I'm pretty sure this place was not built to be a pizza restaurant... It's super small so when there's a few people in line, the only place the line can go is out the door, where people are sitting and eating. Another weird thing I noticed was that the trash can opening didn't fit the plates that they serve the pizza on...It's like an 8-inch opening so you have to crack the plates in half to be able to throw them away... Very odd. The staff was young and rude, they seemed robotic. And last but not least, they didn't have cheese or pepper shakers. What kind of pizza place is this?! I asked for Parmesan cheese and she went under the counter and give me a packet. When I asked for two she roller her eyes lol. That was the last straw for me! There are plenty of other places to eat in downtown Summerlin.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] The pizza here was nothing special. For the price I paid for the pizza slice, the taste was decent but nothing I had not tried before. There is not a lot of room to sit inside the restaurant. Not a place I would usually go to. I would only come back if it was my only option of food.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Nice staff, but horrible tasting pizza. Bland flavorless pizza. The Cesar salad comes as a mound of harshly torn romain, with a small side of dressing even the packing doesn't make sense. The salad was hard to eat and had no substance. The Stromboli I order looked amazing tasted rubbery and gross. Overall the only perk was the beer. Out of all the places to eat in DT Summerlin avoid this one\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Don't even bother stopping to eat here. I stopped and tried a slice of pizza with mushrooms and a garlic knot. The pizza dough was too thin in the center. The first half of The pizza slice was soggy because of it being so thin. What others are saying about the garlic knots is true. It just tasted like a roll of bread, not much garlic flavor at all. Also, it was busy when I went in. They need a better system of identifying who's food order is up on the counter. They placed my food on the counter and someone else came and grabbed my plate and started drinking my drink. I find this very bothersome, I do not like the general public touching my food.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I can't eat pizza but Ive been craving it all day, so I figured I would cheat on my diet and indulge in a single slice. Just one!\n",
      "\n",
      "Their pizza looked fresh and delicious, despite sitting out ready to be ordered by the slice. My mouth was watering as I waited to be helped...\n",
      "\n",
      "A minute passed...and then another...does anyone work here?  Impatient and desperate to satisfy my craving I peeked my head over the counter to discover the only employee taking a huge bite of a slice of pizza.  With a full mouth, he tried to utter \"I'll be right there.\"  I turned around and walked out.  I lost my appetite. \n",
      "\n",
      ":(\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Good Stromboli.  Probably best place to eat that won't break the bank at downtown summerlin.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I don't write many 1 star reviews but this place was a big disappointment. I guess I shouldn't have expected much from a pizza place in the mall. This place really just seems like an sbarro that was rebranded. Flavorless sauce and $5 bucks a slice better to not waste your time. They should be ashamed to use a name like Bonnano and have such bland pizza.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Walked in and the employee was texting on her cell phone. I was not acknowledged or greeted so I stood there and stared at her as she continued to text away. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then her coworker (the cook) came out and greeted me which seemed to snap her back to reality as she jumped, stashed her phone away, and says \"what can I get you?\" No sorry, hello.. Nothing. The two then laugh amongst themselves. She also didn't listen - I said I wanted a bottled water and she poured water from the tap in a to-go cup. I had to re-ask for a cold bottled water from the fridge. \n",
      "\n",
      "The plus.. The pizza is very good.. Big slice, a lot of flavor. 2 stars is for the customer service.. But the pizza is 4 stars.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Pretty average pizza, probably worth a two or three star review. The problem... we ordered several varieties and the clerk immediately reached for the oldest, nastiest, most burnt piece available of each variety, all the while pretending not to hear or notice us specifying which slice we wanted.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Love the pizza here! Got a whole pepperoni pizza for about  $23 and it was worth it! The pizza can easily feed 4 people and it was super good!\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I'm just going to come right out and say it! I prefer this pizza over Pieology's. There it is! Up in the air! I like it better!\n",
      "\n",
      "The pizza here is a great snack when you've been walking around Downtown and need an afternoon bite before your ice cream taco. It's cheesy with a crisp thin crust! Mmmm...\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] The pizza's sauce has a nice taste.  However, pizza in this state is tough. Hard water and dough is just not a good match. The staff inside the pizza area I have found always friendly and with smiles on their faces.\n",
      "Now, the restaurant side.  I've been 4 times, first time was when they first opened.  I will skip that tale.  Then I tried it again 6 months later.  A friend and myself were seated at the bar.  The bar had about four other people and this female bartender we had was awful.  She was busy chatting and helping the two men on our opposite corner.  We would've been better off serving ourselves.  We asked for every little thing, I mean everything- utensils, water a drink and yes. Even menus. She had no regard or knowledge of the menu, let alone manners. What she did have was an attitude.  My thoughts with any business is this: she was hired by them, hence that speaks volumes of the establishment.  It is a reflection on the business.  I was in Downtown Summerlin last night with the same friend and we dined elsewhere.  As we walked by as I snapped the picture we recalled that lack of a personality bartender. Never again.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Their pizza is a hit and miss. Sometimes it is real good. But at other times it is not worth it. The price is right and a life saver, the next time you in a hurry and are hungry. They sold the Italian restaurant next door. Which in a way was a blessing. They made an excuse to sit me in their restaurant because I was in an electric wheel chair. When most of the place is outside anyway. I could made a fuss but it wasn't worth my time.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Downtown Summerlin is the perfect place to grab a slice before doing some shopping. Bonanno's is good NY-style pizza. Slices are a little pricey. I had a slice of cheese, a slice of veggie and a bottle of water for $14.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a cool spot to eat and people watch. They use good ingredients and the crust is crispy enough to hold the pizza without it flopping over. The slices are a good size. You can fold them or tear it in half. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bonanno's is good pizza in a fun location, but they are stuck on Strip prices. Bring the price down a bit and this place is a 9/10.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] As good as frozen pizza from the grocery aisle. Mushroom pizza had a few pieces of canned or previously frozen mushrooms. Mushrooms were soggy, ugly and tasteless. And all three employees behind the counter do not greet you nor do they thank you for your patronage. Maybe the service is the only thing that is authentic New York style?\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Been here few times but last night I ordered whole pizza to go. When I get home we have to throw away over half of it. I ordered well done half sausage and pepperoni but the pizza guy rush it and not cook all the way. Remember I ordered well done. Paid a lot for it and wasted my money. Just really tick me off because I was expecting a good pizza.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I enjoyed their pizza. I ordered the stuff supreme pizza and was not disappointed. If you're at shopping at the Summerlin mall, this is a nice place to stop and grab a NY style pizza.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Solid 4 stars! \n",
      "I've been craving pizza from back home. I wanted a slice with a little grease on it, the cheese melted perfectly, a slightly sweet sauce and the crust cooked so perfectly, when you fold it, the bottom lip falls over. I wasn't expecting much. The pizza looked like it was out maybe 5-7 minutes and I generally don't like the way they reheat, but since it was quick, it came out quite delicious! I'd prefer a little sweeter sauce, but all in all, it was pretty good. I imagine a fresh pie would be even better. It was $3.45 for a plain slice, but it's Downtown Summerlin, so it's to be expected. They didn't have a take home menu, and they dont offer much else besides pizza. I'd suggest coming around lunch or dinnertime when the pizza should be kinda fresh. I will definitely be back here.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Great pizza at an awesome spot. The owners served us outside and were super friendly.  I will be back again soon!\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] This place has an advertisement outside that says \"Two slices of cheese and a drink for $7.95.\" When you add a topping to it they charge $1.70 per slice. That's what one would normally charge for a topping on a large pizza. They charge it for five pepperoni slices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pizza wasn't great either. It was super greasy, which some people probably like, but I don't. The crust was excellent and it was cooked nicely but there wasn't enough cheese. Too much of the slices had red where there was no cheese at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was also annoying that there is no place to wash your hands, something needed after handling the greasy product, much less before eating. There are no bathrooms in the restaurant that I saw.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I'd rate it a 3.5 if Yelp let me. So we were walking around after we went to get some things and decided to try this place out. It has a nice out door sitting area and inside there's some more seating. \n",
      "\n",
      "The girl working (Marbella I think?) wasn't that friendly. She seemed like she didn't want to be there. I asked to Doctor Pepper since they only have Pepsi products and she responded saying \"it's been tasting flat all day.\" Okay? Go change out the syrup? I'd understand if they were out of that but if you have it and purposely don't change it, that's just lazy. We were asking what kind of energy drinks they have (only rockstar) and she responded \"it's not part of the special.\" We know. Thats not what we asked you. Smiling every once in a while wouldn't hurt either. \n",
      "\n",
      "They have beer so it's always good. Mostly domestics but they do have Fat Fire so that caught my attention. You can buy a pizza for $20 or buy it by the slice. They have Stromboli's for $8 so we decided to try two slices and split a Stromboli. 2 slices and a drink for $8, not bad. Especially since the slices are too big to even lift! \n",
      "\n",
      "Now we got cheese pizza since that was the special. The marinara sauce needed some salt. It was great besides that. The Stromboli was really good. Amazing amount of cheese (never too much cheese) and pepperoni but also needed some salt. When I added salt, everything came together so much more. We both agreed that the Stromboli was better than the pizza itself! I enjoyed this place. I'll definitely come back!\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Okay pizza for a baller price. \n",

      "I ordered a slice of pizza which pep and sausage for$5! So I automatically thought this pizza has to be amazing. \n",

      "Nope. It was just your average thin pizza. The pizza wasn't even hot and has been probably sitting under the lamps for a while. \n",
      "\n",

      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Pizza and garlic knots are good! Service was terrific. Rick was helping us. Thank you!!\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Decent quick-lunch option in Downtown Summerlin, they sell by the pie or by the slice. Snagged a $4 pepperoni slice, decent crust but not the thin and foldable type I expected with NY in the name. I appreciated that the slice wasn't too greasy, but didn't really like the way they reheated it. Layout of interior does not facilitate any sort of line, but they do have some outdoor seating available.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that they have a Yelp check in offer for $1 off purchase over $5- do yourself a favor and order a slice plus a garlic knot (too carby for me), and with the discount it's actually less than the slice alone. You're welcome.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Chesse pizza was very good! The crust was crunchy and soft. The staff was friendly and I love the interior decorations. They also have patio seating too. Great place to hang out at!\n",

      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Delicious stuffed pizza and stromboli in a quick service establishment. Great service and friendly atmosphere\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I don't know if the slice I had today was sitting out all day or what... It tasted like mush in the front and the crust at the edge was so hard I could have thrown it at the chef and taken his eye out. Absolutely the worst pizza I've had out here, a waste of $5. DOMINO'S pizza is better.... and that's saying a lot.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Italian', 'Restaurants'] A small place with about 10 tables.  We both had pasta dishes which were great.   a-la-cart salad & bread sticks.  Only soft drinks.  Service was fast and prices were reasonable.  I liked that they offered a small & full size on the pasta dishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "PROs - the main dish, 5 stars for a small town Italian.\n",

      "Fast Food ['Restaurants', 'Fast Food', 'Delis'] I truly feel that this place is clean and sanitary.  When they first opened they had great portions and great prices.

Ever since moving back to Arizona, I have been searching for that same gastronomical experience. I will stop short of saying that Eat This! produces a true-to-form German (or Turkish) Doner Kebab, but it sure as heck does come pretty close.

That being said, this is not your typical am/pm type junk. Let me state that the service here is ridiculously good, I believe the guys name is Steve at the 35th and union hills location, This guy deserves a raise, I have been in the restaurant biz for years and let me tell you this guy knows what he is doing, he is fast, professional, and extremely friendly. As a new customer to Eat This!, he went over the menu and gave me a togo menu as well, on this visit, i got the ganster fries. These Ganster fries are off the hook, a more than ample portion of fries, slathered with delcious cheese sauce and topped with a heap of gyro meat. If you are into cheese fries, I urge you to give these a try! I will be a returning customer and am excited to try the fish and chips. \n",

      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I don't write yelp reviews quite often, but in this case I felt somewhat compelled to. I wasn't expecting much since I've had my share of bad experiences with Chinese delivery (particularly in this area). This, however, was not one of them. Chow Mein House had good, quick service complimented by very well prepared food. Not to mention the place itself is quite nicely decorated. Not bad at all for your run of the mill Chinese place. \n",

My prayers for boba without the 15+ minute drive have also been answered (finally!), and they make it soft and chewy like how I like them.\n",

      "General Tsao Chicken was actually very good. It is kind of food that restaurants can make it salty or sweet, but the fried batter wasn't too thick, sauce was nice and delicious. On the other hand, Mushu Pork and Mongolian Beef was on salty side. Yes general rule of thumb of restaurant is that they cook the food little saltier than dull or less seasoning, but for us it was little too much. Hence we ate a lot of rice and as a result we had to box these two to go.\n",

      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Great service and lunch menu. Staff is friendly and helpful.  Food is excellent and priced at a great value.\n",

Same mysterious soy-sauce-like sauce on every dish. $1.00 surprise up-charge per brown rice request (this is so 2010...) and lunch specials are pretty much dinner priced at $8+. Nobody's doing you any favors here. And what's up with the nasty bowl of wonton crisps w/red sauce? Gross.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weird service and off-putting attitude from some of the most unappealing servers I've ever encountered at any restaurant.

Since it's a Sunday, they don't offer the lunch menu, just a heads up. We ordered bbq sliced pork for appetizer and we really liked it. The sauce it's in is pretty good. We also liked that they put noodles and sweet and sour sauce on the table to munch on. The general tsao chicken was really good. Not to bready which I really like and my mom's pad Thai was tasty. Definitely worth a return trip.\n",

      "\n",
      "The egg rolls were standard and OK.  The Singapore vermicelli had a pepper symbol next to it on the menu but there was little heat to it at all.  Since this was a take out order, I added crushed red pepper from a Thai restaurant I had leftover onto the vermicelli and I made it peppery on my own.  There was a fair amount of been, chicken , and good sized shrimp.  My wife's combo chow fun was good.  It had a nice tasting sauce and they did not add shrimp as requested because she won't eat shrimp.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The take out order was packed well.  I had a 5 minute wait as they had two orders in front of me and my drive is just about a mile.  I was offered water while I waited and the staff was present.\n",

      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] My mom was craving some fried rice but we didn't want to drive all the way to Chinatown, so we stopped by here since this place is right by our house. We ordered for pick up and loved how friendly the staff was and how FAST our food came out! I would say we probably waited for only 15 min max on our 4 orders - Hong Kong Style Pan Fried Noodle, Combo Fried Rice, Chicken Katsu (comes with white rice) and Combo Chow Mein. \n",
      "\n",
      "The food was just alright. The combo fried rice tasted a bit stale and for some reason kind of crunchy. I was also expecting the sauce of the chicken katsu to be tonkatsu sauce like it is pictured in their menu but it ended up being this dark sweet and sour type of sauce that was just okay. The best thing for me was the pan fried noodles and the combo chow mein was pretty good as well. Overall, it's a great Chinese food place if you're in the Summerlin area and don't feel like driving all the way to Chinatown. It wasn't the best Chinese food we've had but it did the part of fulfilling my mom's fried rice craving.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] It was our first time dining here last night and were so delighted to see the white table clothes, flower on the table and wonderful decor.

Can't wait to go back!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I used to like this place when it was China Tango. The price was right for Chinese food. But, now it's way too expensive for its quality. We ordered chicken fried rice yesterday in which the rice is under cooked! They were crunchy and hard. The chow mein has no flavor and it's missing something. To raised their price and lower their quality is just disappointing!!!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] So, I just ordered delivery from Chow Mein house. There are typically a few things I expect from delivery; the food will most likely be cold and it's never as good as dine in. Well, I have been so pleasantly surprised! Wow wow WOW! Not only was my meal steaming, this is the best Chinese food I have experienced in Las Vegas. I have ordered a few Chinese takeout meals and have had to throw away the left overs because they were so terrible. Chow mein house is so amazing and I can't WAIT to order from here again. The portions are massive and I can't get over my amazing meal. The prices were a little above average but it was worth it. The sesame chicken is delightful and the chow mein is phenomenal. I'll be raving about this for awhile. YUM!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I finally found an amazing Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas. It is as far away from the congested and less than clean Chinatown places as one could hope for. Everything about the experience was outstanding. The wait staff was top notch and attentive. We ordered the Mongolian Beef and General Tsao Chicken as a barometer. They were both perfect. The food was prepared in a flash and was absolutely delicious and perfectly cooked with high quality ingredients. The place is clean and relaxed. I wish I could move in!!!! Will be going back again and again!.\n",

Had a late lunch inside, not crowded at all.  The waiter wasn't pleasant nor did he seem happy to wait on us.  Took the order very quickly and brought out the food very quickly, maybe that is why the food wasn't hot.  Taste, however, was good.  \n",
      "\n",
      "There were several employees sitting in a booth next to us eating their meal.  Talking very loudly.  We found this distasteful.  Perhaps they could have found a booth away from customers since the restaurant was virtually empty.  \n",

      "Would not visit again.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I have been looking for a great Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas. I've finally found it!  The food was wonderful. Shrimp, beef, chicken and vegetables were all fresh and the portions were generous. \n",

      "I cannot wait to return.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Solid choice for familiar yet inspired dishes. Chow Mein House has been open about 18 months and has hit its stride, according to some locals. Went with a small group and ordered a number of things to try, with different tastes and requirements easily met. When you start with the lovely deep fried crunchies and red sauce, you're instantly able to settle into your seats.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Corn Egg Drop soup is a good starter and great a chilly night. The potstickers can be either veggie or pork and veggie; steamed or fried. The fried were not greasy, and had a nice flavor, especially in the dipping sauce. Tried the Tempura Shrimp, too, which seemed out of place on the menu, but still tasty. Not exceptional shrimp, but the coating and perfect crispness won the day. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Chicken Chow Mein was a hit. We modified it by removing the veggies (I know, right?) but it was good despite our meddling. The scallops and asparagus special was very good; bay scallops and tons of asparagus with some carrots and black beans in a black garllcky sauce. Also had a nice shrimp and veggies dish (peppers, onion, cabbage and peas) in a eggy clear sauce. If you go with the Chicken Fried Rice, you won't be disappointed - but you may not be blown away. (Not that Chicken Fried Rice is the blow-you-away type dish in the first place, lol).\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, good family-style eatin'. Saw a number of couples, too, so the warm hospitable room makes a comfortable place for all parties. Chow Mein House is a great option. It may not have the razzle dazzle of PF Chang's, but it also doesn't have the three-hour wait on a Saturday night. Nice folks here, and I look forward to visiting here again.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I just dont know why I do it. I read reviews and know better. Yet, there I am ordering food from here.....\n",
      "I didn't realize that I used to be in the particular shopping center all the time. I happened to be in the CVS next door, but was using GPS to find this so I went so far outta the way to get here. (wish GPS would've just said hey, it's next door!)\n",
      "I really wanted to like this place. It's so close to my house. And I love Chinese food. But no. I did not. We spent a little over $60 for take out and it was......eehh. It was piping hot as it had just come from the kitchen (so it wasn't that). It didn't really have flavor. I didn't do anything for me at all. \n",
      "The staff is friendly, the place is nice looking but I wouldn't go back. For $60, I could have had waaaaaaay better food.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] This place was so much better under previous ownership.  They changed ownership and changed concepts.  I've been here several times since the change, and today was the last time we'll come here.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We came for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and the place was empty.  We asked for the lunch special menu but he said they don't offer it on weekends.  This may fly in big cities, but every other Chinese restaurant that I've been to in Vegas offers their lunch specials 7 days a week. \n",
      "\n",
      "They've switched to linen service.  Why?!  People in the Albertsons plaza in Summerlin aren't looking to dine at a linen service Chinese joint. \n",
      "\n",
      "Food was good. Service was terrible.  There were three servers watching the TV while there were only two tables (including us).  Our waters never got refilled.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] It has finally come down to this in our quest for decent Chinese food: either bite the bullet and drive to Spring Valley, San Francisco, or New York, or hop a plane to Beijing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only reason I'm giving Chow Mein House two stars instead of one is that I liked the minimalist modern decor - lots of white, a bit of light wood, and green bamboo plants for contrast.  But the food sucks.\n",
      "\n",
      "We skipped soup, not surprising in 110° weather, but only because we couldn't agree on one.  I wanted to be able to compare the hot and sour with every other place we've had it, but my husband wanted a different one.  So we just ordered two entrees:  Beef curry and Szechuan chicken.  Unlike everywhere else, this fowl (foul?) dish had no ginger listed, so we asked for it.  We also added broccoli.  In the interest of full disclosure, we also asked that no sugar and no extra salt be added.  I realize that this might affect the taste, but the dish had no sauce whatsoever!  When I complained, the waiter said \"well, you wanted no salt or sugar.\"  NO!  I didn't say I wanted no SAUCE, just no extra salt.  I've had Szechuan chicken maybe a million times, with and without the sugar/salt stipulations, and this one was in a class by itself.  And it flunked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The vegetables in both dishes were undercooked.  One reason I love veggies in Chinese restaurants is because the crisp-tender results are something I can't ever approximate at home.  Oh, maybe I could if I wanted to use a wok at extra-high heat and then clean up the grease for three days.  Here, I almost broke a tooth on unexpectedly uncooked carrot.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The beef curry had absolutely no taste of curry.  The kitchen remade it, and it was marginally better, but that margin was minuscule.  This dish includes potatoes; they were cooked, but with a texture that was downright weird, somewhat gummy, and they didn't taste like potatoes.  Here, too, the vegetables were woefully undercooked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final straw came with the bill.  I wasn't surprised or annoyed that they charged $1 extra for broccoli.  But they added another buck for ginger.  Note that they did not take off $1 for the sugar and salt they didn't add.  This was, IMO, beyond petty.  And to update a previous negative comment by another Yelper, the upcharge for brown rice is now $2, not the dollar he complained about.  But at least it's now listed on the menu.  In very small print.\n",

      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] BEST CHINESE FOOD IN VEGAS!  Ive ordered from a few places around town and I must say, Chow Mein House is FANTASTIC! It was delivered ultra fast, piping hot, and full of delicious flavor! I liked it so much I decided to go to the restaurant to dine in and I was not at all let down! It was even better than the delivery which was quite impressive. As of this moment, I again placed an order and can't wait until my feast arrives! I'll post pics once it is delivered. Great prices, great service, AWESOME FOOD!\n",

      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] My husband and I love this place. The decor is really nice and the waitstaff is very attentive, but we usually get it delivered because we're lazy! They use Beyond Menu which is much cheaper than the other apps ($2.00 to our place), and we ALWAYS get a coupon for a free appetizer. So, so happy to have this good food right around the corner.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Chow mein house - NOT your average shopping center take out place! The food  is consistently delicious & fresh  and is up there with any fancy restaurant!\n",

      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Feeling upset at the moment. I ordered combination rice, shrimp egg foo young shrimp tempura crab rangoon and 2 drinks. For one they took longer the the time they told me on the phone. I get my food ands not hot. And they forgot my drinks smh... i call them they refunded my card for the amount that will take 3 to 5 business days. But then i go to eat my egg foo young and its horrible. Its burnt and no flavor. I cant tale it back cause im working. Will never go here again.\n",

      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I looooooved China tango.. Not knowing it changed I ordered my usual 2 entrees and soup.. Pulled up and saw the new sign.. Was a little caught off guard but couldn't turn back now. Everything was a little different (recipes vary I'm sure) but it was all very good! Didn't get the Thai iced tea this time which I usually do.. I can't wait to try it next time! Super nice staff!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Terrible food! Found a bug in food n showed it to them n they said it wasn't them? Do you actually think someone would put a bug in their own food after taking one bite??\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] This place is horrible.   No way is this place NY quality Chinese food.       These people have no idea what good food is.    I would never eat here again.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Delicious hot food! Very nice atmosphere.  Silverware was little dirty asked to replace the silverware. Overall good experience!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Tried the Chow Mein because I figured that's what they'd be good for... as well as their chicken curry. Both were just okay. Too many of my non-favorite vegetables in the curry (potatoes were like steak fries) and the noodles were Meh. Definitely not the first place I'll call when I want Chinese food. \n",
      "\n",
      "Used YELP24 and had the food delivered within 50 minutes. Delivery guy was nice, service was convenient but definitely took a little longer than hoped. Next time I'll just drive the 15 minutes to ChinaTown.\n",

      "\n",
      "I would come back but would probably try something different. The sauce was a little too sweet for my tastes.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] First off, be clear that while I have spent over $200 on their food, it has only been delivery, so I cannot comment on atmosphere or in store service.\n",
      "\n",
      "The quick and dirty review is that i am going to continue to order from this location and highly recommend it!  Fantastic quality food, and in my opinion a very good value.  While they are a bit pricey ($10-$16 each for what I order), the portions are LARGE.  Not stupid large like Hash House a Go Go, just very good sized.\n",
      "\n",
      "My problem has to do with consistency, which I assume has to do with delivery.  A couple examples:\n",
      "\n",
      "The first time I ordered i got 3 fortune cookies with the delivery (which seemed appropriate as there were 3 entrees), the second time I got none.  The last few times  I have received 8 or nine.  Certainly not a big deal, but an indicator of consistency and standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first time I ordered Mu Shu Pork they forgot to include the wraps (I ate it with rice and it was absolutely YUMMY).  The second time I ordered Mu Shu pork I asked the person on the phone if I could get 2 extra wraps because I did not receive any the previous time.  He said ok, and when it arrived, I did indeed get the 4 wraps it comes with normally.  But no extra wraps.  And I got charged $1 for the 2 I did not receive, LOL.  BTW, I would have been fine with the $1 charge for 2 extra wraps, as the quantity of Mu Shu Pork is so large it wont fit in 4 wraps!  Just goes back to consistency.  I chalk this one up to language barriers.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a food note relating to consistency, the first two times I ordered the cashew chicken, the cashews were abundant (way more than I would expect being such a high cost item) and toasted/roasted/fried so they had that lovely buttery flavor with the outsides being just a wee bit black for even more roasted goodness.  This last time a bunch of cashews were thrown on top, right out of the can.  Bummer.  Probably because i ordered within an hour of their closing time.\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple more food notes for the foodies:\n",
      "\n",
      "While the Sizzling Rice soup is full of the goodies like shrimp, the broth is way too thin in my opinion.  Perhaps others like it that way?  And I LOVE the presentation of the rice crispies --- they are cut into squares!  Not sure what holds them together, but I guarantee it is not melted marsh-mellow :-)\n",
      "\n",
      "I am afraid to ask how they do it, but the beef in the Mongolian Beef is tender enough to cut with a fork.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lettuce wraps were kinda bland,  Perhaps I am just used to the spicey ones I get at other places.  And to be fair, there is nothing on their menu that would even hint that they were going to be spicy.  I simply ASSUMED....BAD BOY!  The roast pine nuts were a very welcome twist though!  I highly recommend this dish BUT!  Like the Mu Shu pork, they give you a very generous portion of food, but only 4 pieces of lettuce, LOL.  I suggest you make sure you have some lettuce in the fridge of your own, because once again, the portion will never fit into the 4 pieces of lettuce.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Honey Walnut Prawns were not what I expected in the least.  While the prawns were indeed large, and I got 8-10 of them, the House Honey Sauce is a glop of mayonaisey repulsion.  I think they need more work on this one.  The menu makes it sound more like a honey glaze of some kind, but noooooooo.  Sweet mayo does not rank high on my gastronomical delights.  the glazed walnuts could use some work too.  Some were just straight toasted walnuts, glaze not included.\n",
      "\n",
      "To finish on a good note though, I do recommend at least trying this place.  There is a dearth of decent - good chinese food outside of China Town, and I will continue to explore their menu because they have given me hope of finding some really good items.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I really like this restaurant. We ordered takeout last night. We ordered kung pow chicken and combination lo mein. Both were extremely good. The staff is friendly and my order was ready in 10 minutes. I can't wait to try more dishes. I highly recommend this place.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] First time ordering from the Yelp site and also first time eating here. I must say navigating on the ordering page was super simple and convenient. It was nice to have this service offered. So let's get down to the good stuff. My husband ordered the Generals Chicken and steamed rice while I ordered the Orange chicken also with steamed rice. We got a side of wings as well (I wasn't to sure while I was ordering but thought we would give them a try) So we head over to pickup at our scheduled time and the food was already set to go! Awesome! There was a young guy who greeted me and gave me my order. He was very nice and even a little playful. It's great to see happy people while they work. I had pre paid so I walked in and out, super fast, very pleasant and welcoming. When we returned home we were really surprised at how big the portions were. It could have easily fed another couple but since it was just us two we will save for later on (-: our mean was $12.99 because I always order white meat but even then it was totally worth it. There is enough chicken for two and enough rice for two in each meal. We really enjoyed both chickens but my favorite was the orange. As for the hot wings... I don't think I will order those again, they didn't taste bad but just didn't satisfy my taste buds. My husband wasn't a huge fan of them either so we will skip those next time. Overall I still give this place 5 stars because it was generally a great experience. Just because I didn't particularly like the wings doesn't mean someone else won't. We will be eating her again soon and taking my family when they come to visit! Oh yeah when we were checking out online it had a box for coupons and since we spent $30 we got 4 free cans of coke! Hey I'll take it that was super cool. Check this place out\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Absolutely the go to spot for egg foo young lovers it is one of the best I have ever had \n",
      "Super clean well mannered great spot to eat\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Aesthetically contemporary with linen tablecloths & napkins, fresh flowers on each table, and a nice layout of tables & booths. Kung Pao chicken, Orange chicken, Shrimp tempura, and Vegetable soup were all delicious. Request chili oil for an extra level of spice! Adding a better bottled water such as Aqua Panna, instead of Dansani (tap water in a bottle) would be an extra nice touch. Delicious Chinese!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] A very enjoyable experience at Chow Mein House at lunch. I received exceptional service from my waiter Frank, the food was perfectly made and served quickly at correct temperatures. The hot/sour soup was quite good and the Orange Chicken was the best I've had. The hostess was efficient and courteous. I could not have been more pleased. I'll definitely be back.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Was happy to see a new possible Chinese restaurant especially one where you can really sit down and eat -- but we were very disappointed . Not good .. \n",
      "Chicken was dark meat .. Slop. Unfortunately won't return ..\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Got ours to go, but the dining room looked nice. We really enjoyed our dishes....the sesame chicken wasn't overly battered, and nothing was dripping in oil. It was a little more expensive, but I think you really have to pay for higher quality when it comes to Chinese. We will be back.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Delicious! Almost went to P.F. Chang's but decided to take a chance and really glad we did. Not only is the food great but the service is as well. After our meal the owner came out and made sure everyone was happy and we were! I recommend the shrimp fried rice, salt & pepper prawns and the Kung pow prawns. We will definitely be back.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] The best experience I've had thus far since moving back to Las Vegas!!!! The food and service was amazing!!!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] We ordered the crispy duck.  The duck was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  The flavor was incredible.  Really enjoyed it.  Wish I could make it this good at home.  The chow mien was flavorful and had ample chicken.  Really enjoyed it.   For the price and the atmosphere this is now a favorite for Chinese food.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] For a chow mein house, it was the worst chow mein I've ever had. There was an overwhelming fake garlic flavor that took over the dish and I love garlic. Wasn't crazy about the other dishes we ordered. Wouldn't recommend this place.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Ordered today at 3:15 pm. Everything was as ordered except they put chicken in the shrimp fried rice. Delivery was before promised. All of the food was tasty. Shrimp Vermacelli was perfect. General Tsos chicken was great.\n",

      "We would recommend this restaurant for eat in or take out or delivery. \n",

      "Great place.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Excellent food, Beautiful Decour with white tablecloth, little on the Price Side. The reason for only 4 Stars our waiter was a little bit unfriendly OK it was a lot unfriendly never smile and brought my wife the wrong type of tea.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] We tried their food for the first time via delivery.  So, in fairness, maybe it would've been better had we dined in.  But, we didn't so my review is based on what we did do vs. what we should've done.  We chose delivery 1) because we weren't up for heading out anywhere and 2) a review posted that said from the time of order to delivery it was 21 minutes.  Welllll, our delivery showed up over an hour later (we live 7 minutes from the restaurant) and the food was luke warm.  I had General's chicken and it was greasy, too much breading, a little grissley, and too much dark meat.  My husband had the kung pao chicken and it was drowning in sauce and not at all spicy.  The crispy noodle with shrimp and beef was \"eh\" but smelled fantastic (unfortunately the taste didn't match the smell).  Nothing stood out.  Prior to our order arriving, we called the restaurant to ask where our order was (after an hour of waiting) and we were told that the driver had left with our order over 30 minutes ago.  What!?  Was the driver stuck in infinite loop in one of Summerlin's traffic circles?  What else was he doing!?  Not sure if we'll try this place again.  Delivery or not, warm or hot, the food just didn't have the flavor to knock our socks off.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] The food here is good but,just a little to salty. The service is excellent. Prices are reasonable.Will definitely return\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Bad Customer service. Got a order together for 4 lunch specials and called at 3:55pm. They tell me that they stopped making lunch specials at 4:00 pm. This is something that they serve all day but you get smaller portions before 4. So it's not like they put the food away. This is the type of a decision that makes or breaks a restaurant. To many establishments look to say no so quickly but a yes goes along way.This was for going to be for 4 people from 4 different families. Now they lost business from 4 families who will tell others. Plus we cater in twice a month and was looking for a new Chinese place. Next time this place answers the phone at 3:55 for 4:00 deadline they should think twice about saying no.\n"

So I do suffer from a case of OCD so I order how I would eat my food and I started with an order of Hot and sour soup, ordered about $70 of food, he repeated my order and I mentioned he forgot about the soup and he said ok and wrote it down, I gave him my debit card and it got declined no biggie I carry cash so il just figure out why my card got rejected. \n",

Now when my card got rejected it was empty so no problem I know I got money I know it was some thing reasonable, by the time they charge me my soup now there are guest in the place. The waiter looks at my card and tells me \"are you sure your cards not going to get rejected?\" Really I just gave you a different card different color and just gave you $75 cash. I ask for a manager and he comes out and looks at me and begins talking in mandarin I believe to the other workers and they say he doesn't want to talk to me.

      "Preparation of my takeout meal was lightning fast, and just as expected! Their menu is chock full of all the usual fare and I think this place is worth checking out.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] The food here is incredibly fresh, and very tasty!  Easily the best Chinese food I've ever had.  I highly recommend!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Very fast delivery but I live just down the street. Ordered pot stickers and orange chicken. Both were delicious! Not a big fan that the order didn't arrive with silverware/chop sticks/napkins. I will definitely order from them again!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] We used to go to this restaurant a lot when it was China Tango, and it used to be one of my favorites. Chow Mein House, however, was pretty disappointing. The restaurant was very well-decorated and super cute, but the food was a miss for me. The boba drink was not good, as the tapioca balls were not chewy like they should be. We ordered the combination Chow Mein Noodle, Honey Walnut Prawns, Crab Rangoon, and Egg drop soup, and they did not taste good, that we barely ate it.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Our family thoroughly enjoyed our lunch here.  The service was attentive and pleasant.  The food was delicious, fresh vegetables were abundant, it was served hot, and the flavors were amazing.  A must have is the War Won Ton soup ... the best I've ever had.  Enjoy!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] HOT HOT HOT food upon delivery........GREAT JOB! I love it when my food is delivered fresh and hott. \n",
      "\n",
      "This was my first time trying out this place and I placed an order online for delivery. It gave me an estimated wait time of 45-60min. I called the restaurant 5min later to make sure they received my order. The man who answered was friendly and told me it will be about 45min. Delivery was ON TIME and came in 45min and I was so pleased to find the food scorching hot and Super tasty. The lady who delivered it was also friendly, especially when my pups ran to her, smelling her out. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the black pepper steak, pork fried rice, eggplant tofu (my staple at Chinese restaurants and this one was yummy & not oily), crispy chicken noodle, orange chicken, and hot & sour soup. Literally, everything I ordered was yummy & not oily. By far, the best Chinese in Summerlin.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Excellent quality tonight!! Sesame beef, chicken chow mein, veggie rolls and tempura prawns. Delivered early and piping hot.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Great food please try the Mongolian beef great price staff was very nice very clean resturant like the old style  restaurants in new York, crispy  noodles they  serve in the  beginning  are  great\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Ate here for the first time on 3/30/16.....it was delicious.  Would definitely go there again.....needed a good Chinese restaurant.  Loved the hot and sour soup, Kung pao chicken , chicken curry (but I looooove curry anyway) and orange chicken (however were unaware that orange chicken comes with breaded/battered and unbranded/battered).  So you have a choice...do ask as we were not told by the waitress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would definitely recommend...can't go wrong here\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Fresh and delicious. Excellent service. We ordered take out and we enjoyed the food. Tried the Mongolian Beef and Sweet and Sour Chicken, dumplings, and the won ton soup was full of veggies, chicken and shrimp. Best soup!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Chow Mien House has the best service I've ever got! The food there are amazing! We had Shrimp in the lobster sauce last night, and it was super delicious! My daughter loved it so much that we needed to order a 2nd plate just for her... We will go back for more ;)\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] This place is great if you want a step-up from Panda Express. But not ready for a full on authentic Chinatown restaurant where you need to really know your  Chinese food. We have been looking for a Chinese restaurant to replace Diamond China over at Sahara and Valley View since it closed. This is why we decided to try Chow Mein House. The noodle house was nice and clean. Our host/ waiter was very friendly and attentive, pointing out helpful tips on what to order. Except for a little mishap with the water being spilled on my daughter, everything went pretty smooth. The bus person was very sorry. The Service was really fast, the food was very tasty, and the prices were very reasonable. Although we have not found the replacement for Diamond China, this place is still a good place to eat Chinese food. We will be coming back and recommending this place to family and friends. The search continues\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Very quick delivery. We ordered Spicy Beef Mongolian that was good but the Pad Thai was not great.  Way too many bell peppers in both dishes.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] First time here, very good we will be back!Excellent orange chicken and cashew chicken!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Best Chinese food so far in Vegas. Staff was friendly, prices were great along with the food which tasted so fresh. It did not taste too oily or greasy. I would highly recommend this place.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Food is mediocre to horrible.  I'd rather eat at Panda Express than eat here again!  \n",
      "\n",
      "Sizzling rice soup is bland with chicken that was graced with a bit too much cornstarch...avoid!\n",
      "\n",
      "Pad Thai is FULL of red & green bell peppers and purple onions so for my pepper & onion haters out there, do not order this dish!!!  Chicken also tasted like it had been swished around a wok full of seafood....that or it was a day past its prime (I'll find out tomorrow!).  \n",
      "\n",
      "The sizzling seafood dish (#1 house special) should be called swimming seafood stink dish because it is sloshing around in a soupy, dishwater grey sauce that is ick-o!  We picked out the shrimp & scallops to take home & left the rest of the mess (mushrooms that were bruised and probably too old to be eaten, carrots, zucchini, lobster bits & disgusting chunks of non-distinguishable fish). \n",
      "\n",
      "Service is not any better.  Waiter was impossible to understand, sizzling rice soup was sloshed all over the table cloth, wine glass had leftover lips on the rim, water was splashed all over when glasses were filled, plates were clanked and knocked around very loudly & main dishes were served about 10 minutes apart.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Close to home so really, really wanted to like/enjoy this place, but honestly you will have better luck driving to the next red light & hittin' up the Panda.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Best Chinese food for take-out and dine-in that I've found! It's made-to-order and the staff are always friendly and quick to get your order in. The price is about the same as competitors but significantly better food in my opinion! The atmosphere is very comfortable and chic, casual and classy at the same time.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Heading back to the Strip after visiting Red Rock and stopped in for lunch.  I had the Mongolian Beef lunch.  My wife had the Chicken Chop Suey.  The lunches come with soup and vegetable egg roll.   Boy, these meals were great.  The beef was tender and very flavorful.  My wife insisted that her Chop Suey was even better.  The vegetables were fresh and crisp.   I had steamed rice and she had the fried rice.  Next time I go fried.    This is about as good as it gets for a quick $8 - $10 lunch.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Order the chowmein with shrimp was really good very clean restaurant  they give u crispy wonton chips with a sweet sauce was really good typical Chinese service no smile\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Awful experience with this place... The called us 40 min after placing our order online and said they would charge extra for red pepper!!! Never in all the years has that been told to us... like saying you have to pay extra for sauce on a plate of spaghetti... Out of pure principle (and insulting my intelligence) I cancelled our order that would have been late even if I would have been an idiot and paid extra for red peppers... I just don't get places like this.. Do they not realize the American restaurants  are built on customer satisfaction, good food, word of mouth and referral's/ repeat business ...For probably about 25 cents worth of red peppers (their cost) they lost almost an $80 delivery order... PENNY WISE AND POUND FOOLISH....\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] The best Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas. The food is delicious, service is excellent. This is our 5th time here, never had a bad meal. Very clean and nicely designed. White table linens on the tables, and a very friendly place.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Best Chinese food in Summerlin! \n",
      "\n",
      "Pros: Most dishes are good. It's as good as China Town restaurants without the drive. Quiet with non-cheesy decor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons: Pricier than smaller China Town spots.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I'm Chinese.  My husband and I decided to come here and try it out.  When people asks me where can I recommend them to go to have a good Chinese food in town besides Casino... I always said... I don't eat Chinese food in Vegas... Cuz they all changed the recipe...so they should not call Chinese food any more!  But here, today,  I will recommend this place for anyone!! They are having a nice lunch special menu.  Most of them around $7.99 with rice and soup!! Does it awesome?! Not yet! The service is great!  The place is CLEAN!! They are having about 50 different types of CHINESE FOODS!  Come on!! Try as many favor as you want! We will come again for sure!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Staff is super sweet & this place delivers. Portions are HUGE!! Will definitely come back.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] The crispy duck was excellent.  The how Mein was very tasty.   It is not too pricy and the service was excellent too.  Overall it's a good price, place is clean, atmosphere is wonderful, and food was excellent.  I will be back.  .... Came back.  Tried the general chicken.  Big serving and very good.  Had a delicious kick and very tasty.  Also the fried rice was excellent.  \n",
      "Went back recently with a group.  We ordered the general chicken, orange beef, chow mien, fried rice, and katsu chicken.  Everyone enjoyed it.  The orange beef was a bit sweet but still by the end all the food was gone and everyone enjoyed it.  Thus will keep my 5 stars since I would do the same.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] For all intents and purposes, this is your standard Chinese/American joint. Nevertheless, I'm giving four stars because I fully enjoyed my meal here. I had been once before when it was China Tango. Not sure if management has changed or if they just wanted to re-brand. Either way, the place feels the same. The decor is nicely refined. I can see this as a place to actually want to eat out for dinner (as opposed to just grabbing to go).\n",
      "\n",
      "We came in right before 4pm, which was just in time to order from the lunch menu. The items were $8-9, so a little more than \"cheap\" but still decently priced. I had the chicken curry while the girlfriend had the fish in black bean sauce. Both dishes were attractively plated and more importantly tasted great. The service was very friendly. I noticed that they interacted well with the other customers as well. I was wondering if they had built up any regular customers and my observations indicate the affirmative.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I was in the area craving milk tea. Conveniently I spotted a sign advertising boba in the window! The restaurant's decor is modern. I ordered a thai tea and milk tea ($4 each). The cup is probably equivalent to a large at other boba places. It was really sweet and the boba was a little hard, but I enjoyed it regardless.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Excellent dinner!!!! We couldn't help but order more and more!!! Yummy deliciousness!!!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Something in our order was wrong and I told the waitress and she got super defensive saying that she confirmed with us and we said it was okay. Though that's not how we remembered events going down, she still argued she was right. She was so rude that I was in shock. She continued to be rude and short the rest of the meal. The food came out quick but there was truly nothing special about it. There was no salt so there was absolutely no taste. I visit Vegas from LA often and am always eating at new places, but I will definitely not return here or recommend it to anyone I know in Vegas.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] My coworkers and I were hungry so we ordered delivery from here through Eat24. We bought the dinner package A, which came with egg rolls, a choice of soup, two entrees and fried rice. For our two entrees we went with the beef broccoli and the orange chicken. I was a little disappointed with the chicken because it had sat too long (before being delivered) with the cover on and the steam caused it to be soggy rather than crunchy. However, the beef broccoli was delicious and I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. There was more than enough food for us to share and this is a good deal if you are looking for takeout.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Ordered delivery to my workplace a couple weeks ago. Delivery man was waiting for about 3-4 minutes for me to get change (since I was with a client), and when I told him it would be just one moment while my colleague ran out to pay him, he told me \"I'M BUSY.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Really?? I'm sure he felt like a complete jerk when he realized I gave him a $5 tip, on top of their delivery fee. I should've taken it back. I know there are many people who don't tip delivery drivers at all. He waited no more than 3-4 minutes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Othewise, the General Tso's was good. their chow mein had a very oily taste and nothing else to it. not somewhere I'd go back to.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] My wife and I just finished a memorable meal from this establishment.Memorable in that we will remember not to go back.We had lemon chicken and combination chow mein.The menu listed about five different vegetable in the chow mein. Yummy right? Not. I couldn't locate my magnifying glass so I was only able to discern the tiniest trace of them. A one inch carrot string here, another there. The noodles were amazingly uncooked and burnt at the same time while tasting very smokey. The shrimp were absolutely tasteless, the beef must have been taken out of the old cow's home for slaughter and the chicken was quite possibly an old fighting rooster. The lemon chicken consisted of a thin chicken finger like substance with a weak lemon sauce on the side. NOT A GOOD MEAL FOLKS!! My wife picked up the meals at approximately noon and told me, 'There was nobody there\"! I wonder why? Lunch time.........no one there. Pass on this place unless everything else is delicious.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Came here for the first time and ordered takeout. Had checked out the previous Chinese restaurant in the spot, which seems to have since changed management (or at least rebranded).\n",
      "\n",
      "Ordered the:\n",
      "- walnut shrimp (terribly heavy and sweet)\n",
      "- crab rangoons (fluffy, flavorful)\n",
      "- spring rolls (just okay, but came free)\n",
      "- chicken fried rice (amazing)\n",
      "\n",
      "Service and prep was prompt and friendly. Definitely ordering again! Just not the walnut shrimp.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I'm going to give this place 1 star only because the food was tasty, on the other hand bad service coupled with very bad attitudes left a sour taste in my mouth.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] 2.5 stars Just ok. Don't understand the 4 star rating. Food was lackluster and nothing out of the ordinary. We ordered potstickers,  cashew chicken, orange beef and chicken fried rice. Like I said, the food was ok but was about the same quality as Panda Express for a higher price.  We were the only diners at the restaurant and it was after 5 PM on a Thursday. That should have been a red flag. A positive note... the restrooms were very clean and the decor was pleasant. Service was fast, almost too fast. We tried it based on the Yelp rating, but won't return.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Love this place. My family and I have been going to this restaurant for over 8 years. Food has always been great and the service is wonderful. They are from China and don't make small talk unless you want to a speak in Chinese.\n",
      "If you have special orders they will make any changes you would like. Not so spicy, extra snow peas. The lunch specials are the best in town and they include soup if you dine in. This restaurant is the American version of Chinese food. It is not PF Chang's or fusion. China a go go's food is bland. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you cook on wok your delivery service is great.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] We have found our favorite Chinese Restaurant. This place has it all starting with tablecloths and linen napkins. The service was perfect including a visit by the owner and a 5 course dinner for two. We had the pot stickers as an appetizer, then egg flower soup, egg rolls, fried rice, Chicken Chow Mein, General Taos Chicken, then a delicious desert.\n",
      "Everything was cooked to perfection and the service was great. We will be back\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] They serve some flavor able dishes. I order a variety of their menu items. Their green bean chicken is good and their beef broccoli and hot and sour are great. The only comment is on service. It depends on who is serving you and how busy it may be. But service can be very slow at times.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Had lunch with my wife here recently. Pretty good food. Will definitely be going back. Best place we've found in summerlin that's close to our house. There are a few places that will do in a pinch but this place was worth sitting down and enjoying.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Customer service was good, food was nasty like those hole in the wall Chinese American fast food places. Just no....veggie house is way better and more flavorful.....the food was so nasty\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Update: went home that night after eating we all got food poisoning! Called to them to tell them what happened the owner was rude and disgruntled didn't even offer an apology. I spent all day in ER will definitely be calling the health department in the morning! EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK\n",
      "\n",
      "Teng  Z. Review is fake they put that up after we called and told them what we had to try and make it seem like someone actually enjoyed the old food they served us they work with the restaurant don't be fooled! The only review is from today and pictures they put up 10 months ago from, you guessed it chow mein house\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] The food has always been very good even as many times it's changed names.  There are new owners but the food is still delicious.  I ordered the chow mein w/ chicken & potstickers.   Both are delicious & enough for three people.  The potstickers can be fried or steamed... You get 10 pcs. in one order!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] We had vegetable chow mein noodles, sesame chicken with rice, and crab rangoon everything was awesome and super friendly service! Thanks Chow Mein House! :)\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Awesome Chinese food. Food was delivered in a timely manner & arrived piping hot. Delicious!! Finally a great Chinese place on the west side.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] In my 60+ years of restaurant going, this has to be the worst case of restaurant mismanagagement.  \n",
      "We  got there about 6:20 Pm, and there were lots of people waiting, at    6:20 Pm there  were  6 empty tables.At 7 PM ther were still six empty tables.. They made no effort to clean the tables.  Many people walked out in disgust.Waiters would go back and forth to the kitchen carrying one item at a time.  I mentioned that they should clean the tables, and were ignored.At 7:10 we finally left, not even being able to  get our names on a list ,or even ordering take out. I could not tell you about the food.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] We came in today for lunch based on the reviews. we were greeted and seated immediately by a young man.  we immediately were served a bowl of fried won ton skins and sweet and sour sauce.  we ordered two lunch specials.  my combonation chop suey was wonderful, fresh vegies with chicken, beef and shrimp.  it had a large amount of meat.  my partner had the orange chicken which was very good too.  The fried rice was flavorful and the chow mein had a nice hint of garlic.  the lunches were served with delicous hot and sour soup and a delicious egg roll.  Service was vedy good.  Drink refills came quickly.  The decor is very clean and comfortable.  we will definitely be returning when we are back in Las Vegas.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I still miss the old China Tango before the management changed a few months before the name change...\n",
      "\n",
      "BUT, they are putting in the effort, so I can't hate that. \n",
      "\n",
      "The menu has expanded and the lunch specials are great, though not quite the value they used to be. I don't care for the egg roll or the egg drop soup. The soup is way too thick and yolky tasting for my preference. \n",
      "\n",
      "The service is mediocre.....slow and impersonal. \n",
      "\n",
      "I LOVE the Szechwan chicken. \n",
      "\n",
      "I still need to try more of the offerings since they changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it's okay. I will go for lunch unless they really piss me off just because it's convenient to my work and a good value. It's not good enough to invest in dinner for my family though.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] The food is great! They're even willing to leave out any ingredients you don't want which is great for intolerances. Best thing about this place is how fresh everything tastes! It's definitely a new favorite! Customer service is amazing too , they make you feel like you're their best customer even if it's your first time there.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] The garlic chicken and sizzling rice soup are amazing. I also had some Mongolian beef - a little different cooked with bell peppers, but delicious. Definitely will be ordering delivery from this great restaurant on a regular basis!  Delivery was fast and the food was piping hot.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Was looking for good Chow Mein and a friend recommended Chow Mein House on Charleston. We stopped in for lunch and they had really good specials. My goal is as to find good Chow Mein but instead I ordered the katsu chicken which was great. The person I was with had the General Tso's Chicken. The really enjoyed it. The spice and flavor was good and the portions were just enough. Given my first experience I will definitely be going back for seconds and hopefully thirds.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Wow ! Found this place on yelp and it was so close to my house so my mom and I had to go ! Very upscale looking, great place, amazing customer service and the food was so delicious!!!! Most Asian restaurants have a fishy smell to them but this place was so clean and classy . Ordered the combination chow mein, the wonton soup and mango boba drink . Amazing amazing amazing cant say anything more !!!!! Oh and very affordable\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] We really enjoyed it here. The food is very good quality. Our server, Frank, was wonderful and had a great personality. We will definitely be back. We ordered the kung pao chicken, wonton soup, fried rice, and tai iced tea boba :). This place seems proud to offer attention to detail and good service.  One rice, soup,  and one kung pao was more than enough for 2 people. We brought boxes home.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Here for lunch and I can't believe how fast the service is and how good the food is!  I had cashew chicken and it was super hot, fresh and tasted great. Lots of cashews and the veggies were still crunchy. They brought me a huge plate of cashew chicken, fried rice, cup of soup and a egg roll all for $7.95. That is cheaper than going to a fast food place and the atmosphere is nice. First time here but will be back for sure.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] This place is amazing. Everything we ordered was so good! Delivery was super fast. Prices were fair and the menu has good choices. I will definitely be going back to this place over and over.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] First off good food but it arrived with spilled soup everything was wet soup was half full as probably because it spilled chips where wet rice was wet only thing I ate was egg roll\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] The staff here is very appreciative and inviting.   Tasty and simple American style Chinese dishes.  Generous portions for the lunch menu with choice of soup, spring roll and rice.  Key to this place is the food tastes fresh and undeniable fresh and made to order.  No hot plates keeping this food warm.  Atmosphere is unpretentious and neutral in decor.  Other than the fake shoots of bamboo being used to divide the dinning floor into two parts you would never know its a Chinese Resturant. Apparently for dinner service the tables are covered with white linens.\n",
      "Pizza ['Restaurants', 'Chicken Wings', 'Pizza', 'Sandwiches'] Great pizza. Quick delivery. Cool.\n",
      "Pizza ['Restaurants', 'Chicken Wings', 'Pizza', 'Sandwiches'] Despite the hyperbole of previous reviewers, I didn't find Domino's new pizza to be that bad. The sauce is tastier than I would expect from a chain store, the crust isn't quite as dry as it used to be, and having actual slices of Italian sausage is a nice change of pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wouldn't bother with their wings or sides, and haven't tried the pasta. Frankly, I know better than to order wings from a national chain store.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can definitely do better. But Domino's is at least on par with Pizza Hut and Papa Johns. If you want the convenience of ordering online and are just looking for pizza, they're fine. If you want to add chicken or get a quality pizza - look elsewhere.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] co-worker brought this in for lunch- Cant go wrong. he tells me there is a line up at this place all the time. I can understand why.\n",
      "\n",
      "$7- brings you oodles of noodles. I ate half and have the same feeling as I would walking out of a AYCE. Wish I had someone to share this with. Maybe share with myself for dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "$7 for 2 meals?? maybe 3 if you arent greedy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great Value!\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] I did not know there was a food court here. Huh. Came after church with friends on Sunday. Had the Chow Kuai Teow (fried curry rice noodles with shrimp, char siu strips, and veggies). Portions are huge. I had about a third of my food? The box was packed full. Tasty, but not completely mixed (I found a few white noodles amidst the sea of yellow ones). Quite spicy. Thankful for my soy milk. I love soy milk. \n",
      "\n",
      "There is seating, but supposedly, there's a 20 minute limit. We sat longer than that. No one chased us out. \n",
      "\n",
      "I wouldn't say it's my favorite Chinese stir fry place, but it's not bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Logos note: fairly fast. No waits for food court seating. Cheap.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] This place is amazing! Order is prepared while you wait. Food portions are huge and cheap. Have not found anything on the menu that I don't like. Can't go wrong with any noodle or beef dishes. Personal favs are Singapore Style Vermicelli, Beef with Black Bean, Spicy Salty pork chop on Veg Fried rice, and beef with mixed veg on rice noodles.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place is a gem and gets busy around 12 so arrive early.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] The quality of food here is not that great. Sure the prices are affordable but that's only because it's Chinese takeout. So considering it's comparable with other food court prices, I wouldn't be inclined to come here again. (FYI: the chinese bbq rice store next door is so much tastier!)\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered stir fry chow mein noodles and stir fry beef flat noodles - both of which the noodles were too doughy and dense. They also had chewy/poor cuts of meat and were overall very greasy dishes.\n",
      "Chinese ['Chinese', 'Restaurants'] Huge variety of rice, noddles, vermicelli and rice noddles. The price starts from $5.49 (and up) + tax per dish but almost everything comes with a drink (tea or soya milk). Portion is massive even for Chinese takeout. The dish is hot and fresh because they make your dish as soon as you order.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a food court with seating if you wish to enjoy your dish hot and don't want it to cool on the way home.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Mediterranean', 'Diners', 'American (Traditional)', 'Restaurants'] It's shitty diner food. I love it. \n",
      "\n",

      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Mediterranean', 'Diners', 'American (Traditional)', 'Restaurants'] Went here on the recommendation of a friend on a Sunday morning. We were only the people in there, received great, very personable service, and good food cooked basically right in front of us. Oh, and it's real cheap. I think my whole meal was like $6. This is a great hole in the wall diner. \n",

      "It is open 24 hours which is a definite plus if I ever come back to Cleveland.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Mediterranean', 'Diners', 'American (Traditional)', 'Restaurants'] It's one of the most affordable diners I've come across in Cleveland and everyone is always very welcoming and nice. It's been around for ages, so I'm told, and the building is a bit small, but that just adds to the cozy feeling. If you want a stupid cheap burger ( $3) or hot dog ($1.50) or a breakfast made to perfection ya gotta try this tiny little gem out.\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Restaurants', 'Pizza', 'Sandwiches'] An upscale Italian sandwich and pizza spot. \n",
      "\n",
      "I sampled the sausage sandwich and the pork belly. Both tasted homemade...by someone who knows what they're doing. Fresh ingredients, lovely mushrooms and arugula - and some of the best sandwich bread you'll have in the city. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you want a sloppy, disgusting deep fried \"veal\" sandwich, this is not the spot for you. But if you like to treat your body as a temple (as I do!) and enjoy Italian sandwiches, go check out Dante's Inferno. It's also clean, which is unusual for this type of establishment.\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Restaurants', 'Pizza', 'Sandwiches'] I've had better pizza, but I've also had worse. I prefer thin crust pizzas, so if you're like me you may want to try somewhere else. I found the bottom of the crust to have an excessive amount of flour. I ordered extra basil, and they were very generous! Friendly staff, especially Sergio. I'll give it another try.\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Restaurants', 'Pizza', 'Sandwiches'] I have a very short list of places where I can get a truly exceptional pizza from. Dante's easily made the list. It is pizza perfection in my book.\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Restaurants', 'Pizza', 'Sandwiches'] hands down the best sausage ive ever had. it could have sat on the fresh toasty bread all by itself and it would still be a winner!\n",

      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] I have been going to Taco Mich (originally Taco Mex) for about 5yrs & it's been the same taste. Now that a new owner has taken over , the tacos are smaller &more expensive. I'm glad that everything still has the same taste, though. I just newly introduced my friend to this place &he loves it!\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Not bad if you eat in. Stay away from the drive-thru. If you are looking at the menu on the wall, the cashier will yell thru the intercom to hurry up and pull forward. Once you give your money, they tell you to park and wait up to TEN MINUTES for them to f-up your order and bring it to you. This has happened more than once and they get mad if you point it out to them. Taco Bell is next door. Better off going there if you want drive-thru.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] I don't know why it has only sour reviews. Maybe they've made some changes? Me and hubby recently went and we loved the food. Tacos are pretty good in comparison to what u normally get out here. I'm not giving then 5 stars because the dining was filthy. It is a really hole in the wall, about to fall apart kind of place but I would recommend it. Plus, a drive thru..that's cool.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] My dad always picks up breakfast burritos here and they are just amazing. I just get the cravings for them at times. If you go here try them and you will really like them.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Drive thru sucks got my order wrong and actually had to pull up to window due to Boone responding sir in  inside restaurant look cute the set up but really hit no ac just fans Tacos are really small need to Oder 4 to fill up\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] I came in because I was in the area getting my bike fixed and saw the 75cent Taco sign and realized it was Wednesday so I checked them out. Its not appealing to the eyes and the service is pretty terrible and the wait is long but the food was delicious and inexpensive. That's really all I cared about.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] $.75 tacos on Wednesday can't be beat.(but only till 8th). I had multiple types of meats and I gotta admit I will only go back for Pastor maybe Carne Asada. The pastor was very tasty. And man! Their salsa is hot!! But delicious!!! Had to order some extra to drench my tacos but if ur not into spicy food be careful. I only had their tacos so I can't speak for the other menu items. Their burritos looked pretty big and only $4.50 so I will say it's worth a try next time. Don't be scared of the area, and if you are you could order from the comfort of your car in the drive-thru. :-)\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] My sister went to get some food and they gave her the wrong order she had to comeback and they mess the order again so my sister called the place to tell em about it and the cashier Norma gave super rude attitude to her thru the phone so I decided to go to this place for an explanation about the food and this person attitude, but there is not manager at the time so this lady ask me what solution I want for this problem so I said I want to have my money back but she just gave me a rude attitude again and lies about what happened and didn't fix the problem, I don't know how this place don't care about the costumer service but definitively not coming back there and food that day was bad when usually they were better\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] This place is amazing! Got our food to go and loved the Tacos and rated the burrito that my husband got - very good, fresh and authentic. Definitely going back to try some other menu items!\n",

      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Que robadera son estas?! $1.25 por cada taco, $.50 cobro por transacción de tarjeta de crédito, $.68 más si quiere horchata. $1.25 no es el valor indicado por el taco pequeño que le dan y eso que tampoco no dieron suficientes condimentos para dos personas. Si estos son los tacos de los adultos, que les darán a los niños. No vale la pena el precio ni el tiempo que gaste en ir.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] I don't write a lot of 1 star reviews so when I do its a matter of life and death. All joking aside do not eat here. The food was okay but while we were sitting down eating my son tells me to turn around and look and we both noticed a huge sewer cockroach climbing up the wall. He told the worker that was cleaning up he grabbed the Cockroach off the wall throws it on the floor and steps on it. Please don't eat here absolutely disgusting. I've never seen anything like that before while I was eating somewhere\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] So disappointed. Rude employees. Gave me the wrong order. Refused to remake the order. Gave my wife chicken tacos instead of beef. The store was not clean. Cook had gloves on and sneezed in his hands and continued to cook. Yuck. Good salsa though. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Literally my least favorite Mexican food restaurant in Phoenix their food is horrible flavorless but when you are up at 3 a.m. and are starving it is a good fix\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Service is BEYOND shitty, I've had my order messed up on more than one occasion (fortunately it's always been stuff I'll eat). That said, the Al Pastor tacos are ON POINT! The carne asada isn't bad either, and that is my sole reason for returning to this place. The other location(s) don't seem to suffer from the lousy customer service though.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Taco Mich is my favorite local mexican food around GCU. This location is the main location while the one on camelback is one of the sister locations, the aunt owns that one. Taco Tuesday's are on Wednesday here just FYI. The food is great I can't say it enough. Drunk, late night munchies, or a quick dinner -this place can do the job. The price is right which makes it better. It's all fresh food too. I'lll never go to a 'bertos again.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] I ordered Carne Asada Burrito, 1 Taco de Asada, 1 Taco de Cabeza, 1 Taco de Lengua, 1 Taco de Pastor. The tacos are small and the burrito was more tortilla than anything. The meat  tasted like it has been reheated, not fresh. The tacos had more union than cilantro. I would not recommend this place to anyone, and I will not be returning. This place needs to have fresh prepared food, if they did this they would probably have potential.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] This has to be the worst \"Mexican\" food I've ever tasted. Maybe it's an acquired taste. This place is horrible. My carne asada nachos were exactly the same as the nachos you get at the movies or 7-11. How they attract customers is beyond me. Obviously Phoenix is in dire need of authentic Mexican food. The place is a dump. I'll never return.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] To bad I have to give any stars.  Should had known when speaker was broken.  The all day menudo for Saturday and Sunday was not served in the evening.   Strike two.  I ordered my food and 27 minutes later finally got my three tacos de lengua.  I called three times and I asked where my food was, as I was asked to park at the neighboring business.  I opened them up and they were the most tasteless tacos ever.  The tortillas tasted like they had been warmed up in water. I went home so I could doctor them up.  Will never go back here and horrible experience.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Best carne asada in town!\n",

      "Excited to try the other location close to my house.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Carne asada tacos are great! The salsa too hot for me lol so I get on side!  Employees are friendly and knowledgable. Usually get the tacos cuz they're cheap and delicious but they're small so I end up spending the same as I would on a dinner plate.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Ordered the 5 tacos & Medium Drink deal..(I was hungry and ate 3before I took this photo.. ) Lol. Got it with pollo asada. Asked for Xtra cilantro and onion.. That didn't happen. Tacos are really mini and when I got home tacos looked thrown together wrapped in foil. Not the greatest presentation.  Prepared Very sloppy. Their salsa is not all that, but it is spicy! I liked that they gave me lemon without having to ask! Tacos tastes okay.. If I was drunk they would have probably been amazing. For the pice, I could have gotten more from a Fili B's! Their five taco combo can be made in to ten with all the chicken they serve. If it's the only taco shop around.. Sure. Otherwise I think I'd rather get tacos from a FILI B's!\n",
      "\n",
      "Judging by other pictures for this spot.. Looks more appealing to eat there rather than taking it to go!\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] This is probably the most I've ever waited in drive-through, I think I'm going on an hour. The drive-through speaker doesn't even answer so I pull up to the window and the first thing lady told me is she sorry they're busy. But what I see is one lady in the kitchen another one at the front counter eating and one lady managing drive-through and the front counter. I could drive off like 2 other people have done, but I figure I might as well try the food since I waited this long. What I see is serious understaff!!! And it's not even a weekend... it's Wednesday for crying out loud!\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] I DO NOT RECOMMEND COMING HERE !!! They will take 10-15 mins just to take your order if not longer . Then you have to wait another 20 mins for your food to be ready ( I only ordered a carne asada burrito and a quesadilla and I waited almost 20 mins ) not to mention the horrible service the lady had an attitude and did not mention I would be charged .50 cents for using my debit card which is nothing really I just think it is something they should tell us before processing the card. All in all the food was some what decent not the best but not the worst . That's the only reason I'm giving 2 stars but I would recommend you go anywhere else before here unless you have time to waste waiting for your food !\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Best authentic Mexican food in all of arizona. Would have gave this place 5 stars on flavor alone. However customer service at the register is hurting. And no bathrooms. I doubt we will ever be returning for these 2 reasons alone.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] This place has the most Disgusting-est food in all Pheonix  Yuck. The quality is bad the meat is cold it lacks flavor the eat in is filled with cockroaches and the drive through takes about one hour so they can come and give you a goat turd size food, just plain HORRIBLE, never ever eat here\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Top 5 of my favorite taco spots. The red sauce is close to king taco sauce. Really good. 24 hrs is def a plus always come here\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Very good fresh tacos $1.10 each.Wish we were here on Wends. When they are .75 I had the chicken - a bit spicy, definitely had a \" kick \". Street taco size was perfect . Daughter. & Bf had carne asada, said it was \" good and fresh \" We ordered a horchata to go with perfect to cut some of the spice.Small place but staff was friendly & fast.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] I had a hard time giving them 3 stars, food is great, but the cashier was made of out of rock. I came into the restaurant with a smile and acting polite, my small talk (which is what they should be doing) was abruptly brought to a halt by the cold face the cashier had. She didn't smile at all, neither did she respond to my politeness. I've felt better at places that have automated cashiers.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] HORRIBLE SERVICE. Took the order almost 30 minutes to come out. The employees wer very ghetto and claimed oranges wer lemons. Behind the kitchen there was like 8 people and none got things done. Employees wer drinking soda and placing it on the prep tables and wer not wearing gloves. This is pathetic. One of my favorite places had gone Down. Never coming again.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] it more seems like youre just hating on the place i've been going to this place for years its always been the same cheap great tasting food. you can go to the other places where your food can be so expensive and nasty its not even authentic mexican food it americanized food. if you can actually compare it to the taco stands in mexico thats because its real if it doesnt even look like that then its not authentic you can say whatever about this place but for me its the best real mexican food place other places are just imitations..\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Great little local find - simple, authentic Mexican food at crazy low prices!!  Tasty too - what else can one want?  :)\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] These tripa tacos are the absolute best tripa tacos I have ever had. I had gotten used to the nasty tripa tacos I used to get in Texas. They were so bad, fried within an inch of their lives and hard as shoe leather. Taco mich has some amazing tripa tacos, and their carne asada tacos are pretty darn good too. Be careful with the red salsa, it is easy too put too much on your tacos and ruin them by making them inedible. The horchata is very tasty as well, none of that overwhelming coconut flavor like at some places.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Moved from LA to AZ about 4 months ago and I have to say this is as close as it gets to LA tacos. Absolutely delicious. Its very inexpensive. Definitely my new favorite place\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] The customer service was great and The employees are very knowledgeable of the large menu and it's offerings however the product quality was lacking. The meat did not taste fresh by any stretch of the imagination. The only salsa offered with the tacos was burn your mouth off hot!!! Therefore, I was left with no option other than chewing down dry tacos.\n",
      "Fast Food ['Fast Food', 'Diners', 'American (Traditional)', 'Burgers', 'Restaurants'] DO NOT make the mistake I made.   We decided to order Breakfast / they had huge images shown looked good.\n",
      "Well - the Pancakes were Gray !!  Not golden ---\n",
      "But gray.   The didn't give me my money back because couldn't find the receipt, even though it was 1 months minute prior - I had to swap for some water.\n",
      "One of the Workers decided to argue with me...She said \n",
      "\"Of course they are not golden, they are cooked in a microwave\".  - note the image on menu - Golden Pancakes.   Nobody stepped up to even try to resolve \n",
      "It politely.  Total lack of Respect and management.\n",
      "Customer Service is non existent.   Another family was going through the exact same thing.   DO NOT EAT BREAKFAST AT JOHNNY ROCKETS!!!    It's awful.\n",
      "Burgers ['Fast Food', 'Diners', 'American (Traditional)', 'Burgers', 'Restaurants'] This restaurant at the MGM is poorly run and the employees are not motivated to serve the customer. During my visit one of the employees was starting work and looked right at me and said I'll help you after I log in to her register. She walked away, turned around, and started to laugh. Her manager took my order and when it was ready (I had it to go) I hurried to my room. The burger was over cooked, lacked their special sauce, and was unappealing. Don't bother to buy any product here as management is unresponsive to date.\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Nightlife', 'Steakhouses', 'Bars', 'Sports Bars', 'Restaurants', 'American (New)', 'Burgers'] Went for lunch today.  Mozzarella sticks were barely warm.  Waitress kindly brought out a fresh order.  I had double crunch shrimp as an entree.  Honestly, I've gotten better quality shrimp from my local grocery store's frozen food dept.  The coleslaw served with it was literally inedible.  Little to no dressing and tasteless.  Service was good though!\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Nightlife', 'Steakhouses', 'Bars', 'Sports Bars', 'Restaurants', 'American (New)', 'Burgers'] My hubby & I went to dinner here tonight and they messed everything up, my hubby got the wrong beer and then he ordered a steak medium snd it came so well done he couldn't eat it. Will not be going back.\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Nightlife', 'Steakhouses', 'Bars', 'Sports Bars', 'Restaurants', 'American (New)', 'Burgers'] My folks love this place and I can't imagine why.  I had the chicken wrap and it could not hold a candle to the wraps at the Great Dane.\n",
      "The fries are so overly seasoned they are almost impossible to eat without a huge glass of water.  Don't go there.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['American (Traditional)', 'Nightlife', 'Steakhouses', 'Bars', 'Sports Bars', 'Restaurants', 'American (New)', 'Burgers'] Excellent value with a lot to choose from.   A young lady named Hannah rocked out the service to really upgrade the experience.    Set up is nice where you can pay your bill automatically without having to wait which is a real cool thing when you're in a hurry.      Hannah was really awesome though which brought the rating to 5 stars..   Nothing like fantastic service.   The drinks came out fast and the food came out shortly after..   Bravo Applebee's..  Bravo Hannah...\n",
      "Steakhouses ['American (Traditional)', 'Nightlife', 'Steakhouses', 'Bars', 'Sports Bars', 'Restaurants', 'American (New)', 'Burgers'] Another chain sit down by the mall,  but not at the top of my list. The food hasn't seemed to change since I've gone here except for less options.  Waiting for a table is common unless you go at really off peak times. Recently got a burger there. Asked for well done,  and burger arrived bloody and red.  Waiter took it back and about 5 minutes brought the same burger back and was still pink on the inside.  Was offered something else,  but the others I was with were already done.  Did get a coupon for a return visit. Good deal with the 2 for $20 and an app if your food is cooked right.\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Nightlife', 'Steakhouses', 'Bars', 'Sports Bars', 'Restaurants', 'American (New)', 'Burgers'] This review is specifically for one of their servers, Jayme. My friend and I were in town Saturday night from Chicago for the Brat fest, and we decided to stop here before heading back home. From the onset you can tell he is very courteous and attentive, as any server should be. At first glance it appears as though he's the only one working the entire restaurant because he's so busy attending to everyone's needs, including at the host desk. However, Jayme was having a difficult night due to unruly and disrespectful customers who were demanding his time unnecessarily. My friend and I observed him treating everyone with the same level of kindness, respect, and attention - certain tables were the problem, not him. To the management - please give him a round of applause cause he's amazing and clearly a harder worker than the other servers (that evening). To Jayme - you're so great, don't let a handful of idiots stop you from being a good person!!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['American (Traditional)', 'Nightlife', 'Steakhouses', 'Bars', 'Sports Bars', 'Restaurants', 'American (New)', 'Burgers'] TL;DR: Struck out a few times with initial beer and food choices being out of stock at the bar and kitchen. However, the food we ended up ordering came out as we asked: steak cooked medium, substitute steamed broccoli, and multiple food allergies noted. Our server, Alyssa B, was a true gem providing excellent customer service with an amiable attitude and sincerity to do her job well and try to make us happy. \n",
      "\n",
      "On a blustery Tuesday night, we visited this Applebee's. The host (who was what seemed to be a very shy high schooler) seated us quickly. Within a few minutes, our server, Alyssa B, stopped by and was friendly even though it seemed she had quite a few tables that were sat in her section. Here's the low down:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) We ordered a beer but the server had to come back and let us know it's out of stock. No worries, we ordered something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) We ordered our entrees and let her know our food allergies. But she had to come back with the allergy menu because the kitchen was a bit nervous and wanted us to double check it. Again, no worries because it's better to be safe than sorry. We were good to go, or so we thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Alyssa came back once more, very apologetic, and let us know one of the entrees we picked is sold out. We ordered something different.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Maybe 5-8 minutes later, my order came out alone. Alyssa came by with two plates and explained that she noted we mentioned we were sharing anyway so she didn't want to make us wait even longer than we had been for the second entree. That was actually pretty great because we were hungry. \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The second entree came out not too much afterward and was cooked medium as requested, which I was pleasantly surprised about because it's often overcooked at chain restaurants.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food was good and the service was great. With at least 5 tables sat in seemingly a short period of time, Alyssa handled each mishap gracefully, which was duly noted and much appreciated. Heck, even after we paid and gave her a 30% tip, she swung by our table to sincerely thank us again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've worked in restaurants and other customer service jobs, and have witnessed both amazingly performed and poorly done work. People often leave reviews for the latter, but I prefer to do them because of the former, hence this review!\n",

A little disappointed in my Berry Sangria.. Wish it looked and tasted as good as the picture. Nothing stood out to me tho. I might go back for their cheese sticks tho:)\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Nightlife', 'Steakhouses', 'Bars', 'Sports Bars', 'Restaurants', 'American (New)', 'Burgers'] What can I say about this place. It was horrible from the get go. It took our sever 7 min before she even acknowledge our table. And then she brought our salads and no silverware. My wife had to get up and get some from the host. A table right next to us got the dinners before us and we ordered before them. It took almost 45 min to get our food. My entree looked like it was under the heat lamp for 20 min. I will never come back to this place. They couldn't pay me enough to eat there\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Service is horrible. Waited over 5 minutes just for our drink order...then had 3 different servers and all of them took forever. Barley got checked on... watch Mexican restaurant doesn't give you free chips and salsa?? Although the guacamole and chips were delicious, they're an extra charge. Food is just ehhh. Got the Carne asada  tacos. They don't even come with Pico de Gallo.... rice was mediocre and beans were delicious. Food is overpriced and service sucks!\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Love this place!! Awesome people !! Great food !!! Friendly service!! Family place!!! No complaints at all!!! Great location !!!\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Food was pretty good service was lousy just way overpriced, skip this and go somewhere else the food doesnt justify the prices.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Food, drinks, and atmosphere were good. Nice addition to Westgate. Only complaint is the management's inability to use a remote control and read a TV guide. We stopped in to watch the end of the Michigan vs OSU game. Of the 14 TV's on display, the game wasn't on any of them. We asked several times to change one of the TV's to the game and we're finally told that the game isn't televised. Instead the West Virginia vs Iowa state game played in our view.\n",

      "Great place to watch a game but I would skip the food.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] First off, this place is WAY better than the other \"mexican\" place in Westgate. Our server was AWESOME and the food was very good! We loved the atmosphere there as well. Yes, it's a little overpriced but honestly, most of the places at Westgate are. We plan on going back one evening to kick back and enjoy!\n",

      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Ate here for the first time today. They've been open about four weeks. Overall we liked it.  I had the lobster tacos which were served with a mango  fruit and they were very good. My daughter's steak empanadas were excellent.   Husband had the carne asada tacos. The meat was good but the taco itself was a little dry--needed some green salsa or something. The rice and beans came with some kind of sour cream drizzle on them which was not mentioned on the menu but the staff was nice enough to replace them with plain ones.  The papas were hot, both in temperature and taste.  Husband thought they had too much chili powder.  Reuben, the manager, is a really nice guy and was very receptive to our feedback which included a suggestion to be able to mix and match tacos.  They promote themselves as a taco shop but did not have very many kinds of tacos.  Overall it was a very good lunch and we will definitely go back.\n",

      "No, I won't be back.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Super excited that a place like this opened up where the shifty magaritaville was. The food and service was great. Sriracha sea bass tacos rice and beans super good. The wife had the enchiladas they were stacked not rolled. I will be back for sure.....\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Place is ridiculous.  Poor coordination of staff.  1.5hrs to get one drink and never got a server for food.  Not anything good to say.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] I had a bad experience the other day with this business and had wrote a bad review.  I had went in on a Saturday and the waitress and manager at the time kept running my debit card through.  I was watching them run my card and watching my bank account go negative because they ran my card through 5 times.  I finally had went up there and complained and they had stated it wasn't going through.  Once I showed them my account on my phone they gave me back my card.  Meanwhile I had to go all week without my checking account because those charges remained pending in my account.  (making me negative).  Wednesday night I was called by the owner of the establishment apologizing for the mishap and made things right.  He went above and beyond to make sure I felt that I was a respected customer and made it better.  We appreciate him correcting their mistakes and using it as a learning experience for his staff.  with this we are willing to give it another shot!! \n",

      "Oh - and the food is awesome!! The shrimp tacos are the bomb!! everything is a little overpriced but very tasty.\n",
      "Mexican ['Mexican', 'Restaurants'] Went in on Saturday November 27 before a Coyotes game.   Sat at the bar for dinner and a Margarita.  I had the prickly pear Margarita which was the worst Margarita I have ever had and my friend ordered the Cadillac Margarita when we told the bartender that it was supposed to have Grand Marnier in it she snapped ar us and said no it doesn't.  The food was ok, nothing special but overall the place is overpriced.  There are many other places at Westgate I would go before I would go this place.\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] Love the old style look, food was good. I was very disappointed with the waiter she was very rude and snotty I ordered a malt and I couldn't finish it I asked her to take it very nicely and she told me to finish it but I didn't then when she came back around I asked her again she got rude with me again and said you shouldn't have ordered it then who the fuck is she to tell me what I should and shouldn't order, I'm the one fucking paying for it, I definitely won't be coming back here again\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] This is a great family owned diner. It feels very authentic to what a diner should feel and taste like. The food was good and the service was great. The food was fresh and tasty. Their portion sizes are big. Defiantly a place you should go to hungry but if your not you can always take it to go. Prices a super reasonable too. My favorite was the chocolate shake.\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] Just before flying back to France, I took my breakfast here. The place is nicely decorated, waitresses were real kind and smiling. Food was good and coffee are free refilled.\n",
      "I'll come back asap.\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] Will go again when in Vegas. We really enjoyed the breakfast. Wish I could leave a video cause a have a cute one with the pumpkin bread. MMMMmm\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] No wait!  Clean, quick, and friendly service. Delicious French Toast Special, Lil Chickadee omelet, and Bacon cheeseburger. Affordable prices and comfy environment.\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] This is a small yet spacious restaurant, very clean. Great decor, that matches the 50s dinner theme. Family owned and managed. I will be back! This place is very affordable and large portions! Perfect for a brunch.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This service here was fantastic! Hands down, from the moment we sat down till the moment we left we where treated great. They offered drinks the second we sat down. The waiter rapidly greeted us as well. After we ordered our food took what felt like no longer then 5 minutes, which was such a relief cause I was starving.\n",
      "The food was so fresh hot and delicious.\n",
      "The server was so friendly I couldn't decide on my pancake flavor so she offered to give me one of each. I loved the sweet cream pancakes, but I'm glad I got to try the original cause those where great as well.\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] Service- very nice women working today seemed pretty busy but we were seated right away. Really great for a Sunday breakfast\n",
      "Food- was okay I was very interested in the chocolate chip pancakes and tried out the petunia pig omlet. Overall it was okay.\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] This place was pretty cute. Idk if I consider this place a hole in the wall, but it was still cute. I also don't know much about the 50's so idk how accurate the decor is. They had posters of Elvis and Marilyn Monroe On the walls. \n",
      "\n",
      "The main reason I liked this place was that it had an actual diner feel. When people in Vegas think of a diner they think of Denny's. They have the wait staff right on the front of the menu. They're all nice. I do wish they wore like a 50's themed servers outfit but oh well lol.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had their smothered steak with garlic bread that came with 2 sides for $12. I chose their soup of the day and their spuds. It was cream of mushroom and the chips they have shown on everyone's photos.  The soup was good, nothing special. I do like their spuds. They're like home made potato chips. They're delicious. If they seasoned them they would definitely be special to me and something I would crave and return often for.\n",
      "\n",
      "The steak came \"smothered\" in mushrooms and grilled onions. My food was okay. I don't expect much when it comes to steak at a place like this but my steak sucked. I'm so sad to say! I assumed they'd be hesitant to do a medium well and serve it pink so I went with medium and it was gray/brown in the middle. It was disappointing. I didn't send it back I just drowned it in A1 but steak really shouldn't NEED that. Also their really should have been a sauce if it were smothered. I should have known to get something easier to not mess up like chicken fingers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways I also had coffee and their 50's platter. The coffee was great and definitely refilled plenty. The platter was an appetizer sampler and was a big portion for 7.99. It came with two chicken fingers, two fish planks, zucchini fries, and onion rings. Everything was tasty. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall I enjoyed my visit. I do like the waitresses. The food was decent. The prices were fair. Won't break the bank but not super cheap. For three people who shared an appetizer, 3 coffees, and three \"entrees\" we spent $40.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would I return? Yes. I'd want to try their desserts like apple pie to see if they're home made. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would try one of their omelettes as they have a whole page of em! They also have all of the classic diner items you'd expect like biscuits and gravy, breakfast items, steak and eggs, and eggs Benedict.\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] This place was awesome for breakfast. The price was excellent. The service was over the top! The waitress had to have filled my coffee 7 times! The food was good. They did charge extra for salsa, and extra for fruit! A must visit\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] You have to try this place. The meals are always scrumptious. The service can be a hit or miss at times but I always come back.\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] Classic 50's diner look and feel. Great Cheap menu, good food,good coffee,good shakes  and friendly service.\n",

      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] First time. Used the comments on Yelp to make our decision. Nice clean place. I had the country scrambler with spuds and the homemade pumpkin nut bread. The GF had the eggs benedict florentine with hashbrowns. The scramble was very good the spuds are potato chips made in house but not fried all the way and had a funny taste to them. The pumpkin bread was delicious. But I was brought frozen butter. The benedict had fried eggs and frozen spinach on them. ??? Different! !!!hashbrowns were perfectly browned on both sides but had to ask for them that way. So a ok brunch.  Don't know that I will go back.\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] Best omelette ive ever had! Had the chicken fried steak omelette. Came with amazing sourdough bread and pumpkin bread! Serious was great, our waitress was very nice, she had blonde hair. Definitely would visit again!\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] The fastest order to table breakfast I have had in years! I was shocked. \n",
      "Excellent service, again a trait that is in short supply.\n",
      "The food was delicious portions were large. Neither my husband or myself could finish our meals.\n",
      "Very 50's campy decor.\n",
      "Will be back.\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] The pumpkin nut bread, as a toast option, is worth 5 stars by itself. We had the healthy vege omelette and the spinach shrimp omelette, both were very good. The \"small\" omelettes are 3 eggs and more than enough for us. I don't know who would be able to eat the large 6 egg omelettes. The spuds are fresh cut potatoes, kind of like large potato chips, and seem more suited for their sandwiches instead of the omelettes. They do have the option to upgrade to hash browns for a little extra. The prices are more than what is posted on this site, but in line with what you would expect them to be. Will definitely come back regularly.\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] Only came here cuz we had a restaurant.com coupon. Bases upon reviews from Yelp we decided to give it a try. \n",
      "\n",
      "Nice, friendly service. Fast in getting our food out. And it was correct on the first attempt! Which in my opinion is hard to find these! Haha\n",
      "\n",
      "Clean restaurant. And the coffee is really good. Will definitely be back on our next visit to Vegas!\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] I do a bunch of restaurant sampling now that I am retired as a hobby. This place is close and had decent reviews so I gave it a shot... the staff was friendly and helpful. I had eggs, bacon and hash browns. All was very tasty. One strange thing that I have never come across... if you don't go with their std potatoes, they charged like 90 cents extra for the hash browns ....\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] Seriously.....WOW!!!!!  Really...Really GOOD\n",
      "Worth the drive.\n",
      "It has been over a month and still remember the food and great service.\n",
      "Unfortunately I forgot what I had but still...should have written a review back then...but still....I have to say I know it was great and can't wait to come again\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] This review is for 4.5 stars. When I think of going out for breakfast, I don't think of the chains first (IHOP, Denny's, or Coco's), I think of the little local places, like Omelet House, Jamms, and now this place. \n",
      "\n",
      "This family-owned restaurant is located across the street from our Vet's (DI Animal Hospital) and over the years, I've wondered how good it was, noticed that there were always cars in the parking lot. Saw the menu online, www.menusearch.net (good prices!) when I did a search recently (friday night) and wanted to scope it out for an upcoming event. \n",
      "\n",
      "No, it's not related to the other Omelet House restaurants, but there are some similarities. (1) You can get spuds, and (2) substitute freshly baked pumpkin bread for the bread choice @ 99 cents, you can't go wrong. There are breakfast specials, $4.99 and under, at the top of the menu (these are updated prices, from the menu online). Add 99 cents for weekend prices. Also, (3) like the Omelet House, this restaurant closes at 3 pm. But you can get breakfast for lunch here, if you like (don't remember if you can get breakfast for lunch there). \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the country scrambler- ham, onions, mushrooms, & cheddar cheese. The pumpkin bread and butter came first; it was pretty good, but only had one bite so I could eat my meal without being full. The spuds were seasoned lightly and very crispy, golden brown, (\"better than theirs\" our server, Veronica said, as we placed our order), and yes, we agreed!- Sometimes the competition's spuds are a little oily and soggy at the bottom. Unlike the competition's large servings (and hence the higher prices), it was just right for me. My husband got the chicken philly sandwich, and I had a bite, it was pretty good, a little ooey gooey (melted cheese on a philly is a good sign), and he finished every bite, too, scooping up the fallen onions and peppers with a fork. Also, my husband helped me finish the bread. Needless to say, was satisfied, and glad that I did my research online friday night. \n",
      "\n",
      "There is a pretty good size menu, lots of yummy selections. I want to try the stuffed french toast next time, or maybe the corned beef hash (my favorite). Lots of items average about $6.00 generally for breakfast, and about $8.00 for lunch. Omelets you can have either Small or Large. Lunch is sandwiches, burgers, chili, soup, salads, and also a kids menu.\n",
      "\n",
      "The atmosphere is totally 1950s, the decor on our side of the wall was Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe, & James Dean. On the opposite wall are record covers. While there was oldies music playing, we also heard hits from the 1970s too. Old fashioned floor, black & white blocks. The bathrooms are marked \"His\" and Hers\". There isn't a baby changing station but I used the stool with a couple seat covers on top (hey, mom's have to be creative sometimes). It was a particularly hot day yesterday and there weren't too many patrons for lunch, a few other parties besides us. Clean too. This is a casual place, seat yourself- lots of booths & tables too. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our server was super nice and when the baby toppled over the glass of water all over the table, she wasn't annoyed, she just acted really fast, and got assistance from two others there. No biggie. With tip, the bill for both of us was $20.00.\n",
      "\n",
      "No longer curious, eager to go back again, this is a little gem in the desert. It's one of those little places that could be featured on DDD, but at the same time, don't want the secret ot be out, either.\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] This place is not far from my house and I've driven by it for years and never went in.  One of my friends told me how good it was so I went with here there.  Their breakfasts are really good.  I didn't like the chips served with the eggs, but next time I'll just get the home fries.  The Decor is very 50's, the staff were friendly and the service was top notch.  I agree with the person that said the place could use a good cleaning, but it would not stop me from recommending the food.\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] When you think of a diner this is what it's all about. Not sure if it's authentic 50's era decor but it definitely has the feel of an authentic diner. We've been coming here for years and it's the same comforting food and great service every time. That's why they've stayed for so long because they're consistent. The only time I had a bad experience was last year when they're A/C units were stolen in the middle of summer but that's out of their control. Don't worry they've been replaced since then. \n",
      "\n",
      "We always order sweet cream pancakes they're amazing. My mom talks about them often. They also have great omelettes and plenty to choose from there's like 2 pages full. Their country fried steak is really good too. It's one of my favorites actually. Their spuds are also really good. A cross between chips and fries. I like them soggy not crispy. They're Not soggy but just softer than then crispy. Dip them in ranch because they have amazing ranch. This picky ranch eating lover approves their ranch. Lol Just don't leave without ordering sweet cream pancakes. You will crave them.\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] If you want some place that is fun and don't have rush for food this Is a great little place to visit. Everything was nice only thing that lowered it to 4 stars was the wait to have our drinks and that we had no flatware. The food was good, the waitresses as busy as they were did their best to remain friendly and as attentive as possible. \n",

      "Price for the food is worth it and you are given a good hot portioned plate.\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] Excelent service.  Veronica our waitress was extremely polite and helpful in choosing  the right omelet.  You cant leave with out  trying the pumkin bread.\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] I'm a big breakfast person so finding this cute diner was a delight especially it being just a few minutes away from where I live. The service is always prompt and very friendly - always a plus in my book. I've had a few stuff in their menu but my favorite is the \"Rio Grande Surfer\" Omelette with spuds. I also get their pumpkin nut bread with any meal I get coz it's just freaking amazing! Their pancakes are also good and fluffy -definitely a must try. If ever you are around the area do not hesitate to try this place out.\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] Today is thanksgiving I was pleased to find they were open for breakfast and lunch, the staff is very friendly and attentive, the food is great, prices are reasonable.i have found my new hangout other than the neighborhood Thai restaurant. Thank you 50's staff for starting my thanksgiving 2013 off great! Happy thanksgiving to you all. I will be back very soon to try your lunch menu   :)\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] I wish this place was closer!  No pretensions, just good comfort food in comfortable booths in yes, comfortable pink walls dotted with vintage posters.  My son and I were greeted with smiles and 50s beach music.  I'm all fuzzy inside.  \n",
      "\n",
      "There really was nothing to fault between the iced coffee and pulpy OJ, to the bacon and soft spud chips (you can order them crisp) to the warm and efficient service.  I really enjoyed the hint of parsley seasoning on the chips and the sweet cream pancakes are GOOD.  So far, the best in Vegas in my book (I enjoyed them more than Du-par's too).  Fluffy and tasty with whipped salty butter and syrup that is a little runny but still good. \n",

      "We'll be back to try the other menu items, especially the apple pie ala mode!\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] Super delicious! My family& I went for dinner& we all loved our food. It's a nice, clean, comfy environment. Great service. Reasonably priced. Felt like a home cooked meal. &&I love the oldies music playing in the background, rather than the annoying pop music playing in most restaurants. We plan to go there for family dinner regularly.\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] This is a late review but we had breakfast here on my birthday during our Las Vegas trip in June 2016.  and WOW it was all I was looking for. I wanted a good hometown diner breakfast big and everything included and boy did I ever get it.  I ordered an eggs benedict and man was it over the top. Everything was cooked to perfection.  I was so stuffed when I left and we spent almost nothing at this place! So great, hit the spot!  My only regret was not making it back prior to our leaving Las Vegas\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] We had a wonderful experience! The food was great and the service was exceptional. We will definitely be back for more. The sweet cream pancakes were by far my favorite!\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] After a log weekend on the strip this place rocks! Super good breakfast even the root beer was perfect. If you lost all your money in the hype of vegas this is a good place to feel better 'bout it.\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] Typical diner food: excessively salty, carb-y, and popular with the old folks. The only positives were the price and quick service... except for our toast, which didn't come out until we were almost done eating.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had an avocado, cheese and tomato omelette with the chips and my boyfriend had the chicken fried steak. It was nice that I could choose between a 3 egg and a 6 egg omelette since eggs aren't the kind of thing you want to haul around in a doggy bag. The chips were good, if a little salty and soggy at parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd recommend this place if you want to detox your wallet after a night on the strip and don't mind filling your stomach with salty carbs.\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] I ordered a cheese omelet and iced tea. I received very friendly service. This location was very busy during this visit. 3 stars for warm and friendly service. The food was ok,but had to be sent back because of under-cooked eggs. I would recommend some detailed cleaning of this location.\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] The decor is a bizarre mix of eras, but I found it rather charming. The seats were fairly comfy, the service was prompt and courteous. The food... eh. I hated their home fries/chips. Actively hated. Also, the majority of the food was over-salted. My friend said the burger was ok, but whatever side he got (chili, I believe) was super salty. We split a piece of pie for desert - no regrets there; that was some good pie. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall A-OK fits very nicely. I would go back, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back.\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] We were craving breakfast and wanted to try something new today. We walk in here and it's so cute and old fashioned. We sat ourselves and the waiter comes up to us and gets our drinks. She was really nice to us! I got the country fried steak and my man got the French toast. The French toast was so delicious. Amazing flavor! It came with two eggs and sausage or bacon (he picked sausage)! Perfect over easy eggs! My country fried steak was sooo good. Better than usual. Most of the time it lacks salt at other places, but here it was perfect! Not too salty but just right! It came with spuds and eggs as well. We also got an amazing Oreo milkshake and I got a Coke as well. All that was $27! It's really fairly priced. Come here!\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] Well when I first walked in I liked the decorations made me feel like I went back in time. But the longer I sat at the table looking around the place I started noticing how dirty things were in this place. \n",

Veronika was really friendly (our waitress).\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] We got here around 7pm ...my hubby order tilapia with mash potatoe and gravy as well as spicy beef soup he really injoyed it... I got a chicken fried steak with garvy , mash potatoes , and fries ...I injoyed it but iwont be ordering the fried steak not my cup of tea to be honest I just felt like trying it once...the sweat cream pancake was good dont notice a difference from the regular only more fluffy... I hope to go again in the moring to give it a different review on different foods\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] We had a great experience here! Fantastic service, absolutely delicious vanilla drip coffee, delicious bread, yummy omelettes!  My daughter got a burger gluten free style with no bun and it was cheesy,  juicy and delicious!  Delicious milk shakes too! Big-time yummy there!  We will absolutely go back. Today was our first visit and we enjoyed every minute!\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] I'm always on the lookout for new places to try for lunch...and after seeing Nelson Q. rave about the 50's Diner and how it was locally owned I decided to give it a try. \n",
      "\n",
      "Decor wise it's literally a 50's Diner...it's not as glitzy as places closer to Las Vegas Blvd. But if you judge a book by it's cover you're going to miss out on a gem. Service? Phenomenal. This is a family owned business and it shows. But as good as it is to support small, family owned businesses it's all about the food. So does this diner get it done? Yes they do. \n",
      "\n",
      "They have a pretty good menu with a lot of items but I'm from the Midwest so when trying something new I tend to stick with the classics like in this case a 3 egg omelet, with sourdough toast and potato slices. I'm not a big potato fan but these slices were a nice change from the usual hash browns you see so much of. I went with a California omelet and was very pleased with it. Lots of chicken, peppers, avocado...it was really filling and really good. \n",
      "\n",
      "I want to go back and try their sandwiches and other items on the menu. I'm glad I read Nelson's comments and took the time to check this place out. 4 Stars. I will be back.\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] Loved this place.  The coffee was excellent and they are very prompt in making sure your cup is never empty.  The spuds are beyond amazing.  The steak was supposed to be medium rare, but came out incredibly \"well done\" and a little dry.  The omelet portions are huge and so worth every penny! Also the pumpkin bread is a must have!! One of the breakfast places I've been to.\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] It has been over 2 months since I have eaten here. I had the same omelet I always eat #36 egg whites only, grilled chicken, sausage,  zucchini, spinach, avacado inside and Jack cheese.  Todays new addition was a side of Spanish sauce that I dumped on top.  All I have to say is WOW, this sauce is amazing.  I have now tried it on the following: fries, burger, hot dog and the California chicken sandwich.  This stuff is phenomenal and ridiculously addictive.\n",
      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] I truly enjoy this place and this is definitely my go-to with my friends for Breakfast! \n",
      "\n",
      "I love the decor on the walls. Old pictures of Elvis, old Las Vegas street view and also old posters which give an extra \"hommie\" feeling to this place. \n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to the food, especially breakfast food, they are amazing! At our visit this time, I ordered 2 pancakes specials which comes with two eggs and bacon or sausage at your choice. My friend ordered Blueberry french toast. I enjoy mine but I have to say his is just over the top, hands down the best french toast I have ever had! The toast is rich in butter covered with fresh blueberry sauce. It tastes amazing! \n",

      "Burgers ['American (Traditional)', 'Diners', 'Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Burgers', 'Comfort Food'] Nice family owned diner. Cute theme. Good food. I took my mom and my great aunt here and it sure as hell impressed them! Very friendly service. The spuds are really really yummy. Definitely coming back.\n",
      "Burgers ['Burgers', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Restaurants', 'Desserts', 'American (Traditional)', 'Food'] I swung by this 5 & Diner an hour before closing (8 p.m.) tonight to introduce my boyfriend to the restaurant that I loved going to as a kid.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we got in the door, we were promptly ignored for a few minutes as we stood around for someone to seat us. We were not greeted or even so much as looked at while we were standing, and there were at least 3 visible employees on the floor: the hostess, a server, and a busser.\n",
      "\n",
      "Needless to say, we walked out. Being totally ignored like we were invisible to the employees standing 3 feet in front of us wasn't exactly a welcoming feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was completely disappointing as I was hoping to make this a place my boyfriend and I could attend for date nights. We won't be trying this location again, especially since other reviews for this 5 & Diner are citing the same issue we experienced.\n",
      "Burgers ['Burgers', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Restaurants', 'Desserts', 'American (Traditional)', 'Food'] Service was not the best the eggs were dry and sausage was not good. The waffle is good, but not the best breakfast place.\n",
      "Burgers ['Burgers', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Restaurants', 'Desserts', 'American (Traditional)', 'Food'] I loved this place it was so cute. We went here for brunch today and we sat out on the patio through another reviewer's suggestion. The waitress we had was wonderful and very attentive. Even though I do not have a dog I loved how it was a dog friendly patio, and they even bring water and treats for your treasured pups! The coffee was good, and I had a strawberry waffle and my husband had scrambled eggs with cheese, toast, and fried potatoes. The music was also cool as we are both fans of the 50's. I will come back here again as it was very reasonably priced.\n",
      "Burgers ['Burgers', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Restaurants', 'Desserts', 'American (Traditional)', 'Food'] My Cobb salad was good.  My husband got the tuna melt and liked it too.  The place is clean and the staff was nice.  It took a little while for someone to take our order, but once it was placed the food arrived quickly.\n",
      "Burgers ['Burgers', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Restaurants', 'Desserts', 'American (Traditional)', 'Food'] If you like  oldies like  \"Over and Over Again\", try the patio mid-morning.  The view of Micky D and Best Buy plus Indian Bend Road noise isn't the greatest but a scattering of tall palm trees make the setting somewhat attractive when you  scan upward.  What is missing, of course, is the beach. \n",
      "\n",
      "The two egg cheese- veggie omelet with hash browns works for me.  For toast I highly recommend  rye for its thickness  and extra seeds.\n",
      "Burgers ['Burgers', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Restaurants', 'Desserts', 'American (Traditional)', 'Food'] The staff is great. Very friendly, great service. The food (burgers & \"seasoned\" chips) I'd say meh. No flavor. Very bland! The seasoned chips had no seasoning flavor or even salt that we could taste. Husband had a malt that really had very little malt taste. The bill showed chocolate shake with 49 cents of malt added. I'm assuming that was one scoop of malt due to lack of flavor. Husband said he'll give them another shot for breakfast. I'm sorry but I'll pass.\n",
      "Burgers ['Burgers', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Restaurants', 'Desserts', 'American (Traditional)', 'Food'] I like 5 & Diner for a few reasons.  \n",
      "\n",
      "1).  They give us kids an idea of what a 50's diner was like.\n",
      "\n",
      "2).  They serve up a mean grilled cheese and fries.\n",
      "\n",
      "3).  They have mini juke boxes on the tables.\n",
      "\n",
      "4).  They have the most amazing shakes ever.  \n",
      "\n",
      "That's all I've got, but it's enough for me.\n",
      "Burgers ['Burgers', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Restaurants', 'Desserts', 'American (Traditional)', 'Food'] Stopped for breakfast after picking someone up at the airport. Seated right away but took ten minutes for someone to take the order. While I waited for the food two tables sat down, waited for a waitress and left without ordering. The food was okay but the orange juice I ordered was very watered down - hardly tasted like orange juice. Won't go back again.\n",
      "Burgers ['Burgers', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Restaurants', 'Desserts', 'American (Traditional)', 'Food'] The service was amazing.  My server was very sweet and real , I would def recommend my friends and family to come here for breakfast. The atmosphere is chilled and relaxed and their food is absolutely amazing. No complaints on my end.\n",
      "Burgers ['Burgers', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Restaurants', 'Desserts', 'American (Traditional)', 'Food'] I've eaten @ the Five & Diner many times with my husband & friends. Whether it's breakfast, lunch or dinner, I've always had a great dining experience & look forward to the next time I visit. The portions are large, the food absolutely tastes homemade & reminds me of eating my grandma's delicious homemade cooking. The open faced beef sandwich on sourdough bread with mashed potatoes & gravy is my very favorite meal. The service is always excellent, even if it's real busy. A great place to go for old fashioned home cooked food.\n",
      "Burgers ['Burgers', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Restaurants', 'Desserts', 'American (Traditional)', 'Food'] In the year or so since I wrote my first review for 5 & Diner, ownership has changed hands. The first thing the new owner did was get rid of the crew (some had been working there 12+ years) and replace them with a very... How should I say... WHITE crew. The previous crew were mostly indians and some Mexicans (the joint is located on the reservation after all). But I suppose it was too dark for the new owners liking.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next thing the new owner changes was the menu. \n",
      "Cheaper options and less flavorful foods.\n",
      "Now, if you want a water you have to ask, where they used to bring one out right when you sat down.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we used to get our food in 5 minutes or less (sometimes in only 3 minutes after ordering it), now it takes 15-20 minutes, even if the place is half empty.\n",
      "We wanted it to work, and visited 4 times after the new owners took over, but alas.. \n",
      "We shall never go back.\n",

      "Burgers ['Burgers', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Restaurants', 'Desserts', 'American (Traditional)', 'Food'] 5 & Diner is okay for a quick bite.  The food is just okay, typical diner food.  The place it's self feels very old. . and not. . .\"oh cool, I feel like I'm in the 50's\" cool.  It has an old feel.  Needs some revamping (chipped paint, ripped benches, broken table juke boxes).  Staff was friendly and helpful.\n",

Whenever I come here, I can't help feeling like I am in \"back to the future II\" and mc fly is going to walk in the front door at any moment.  The diner is something you would see on a 50s movie set. Checkerboard floors, old movie posters and portraits of classic movie stars, fire engine red vinyl booths, mini juke boxes on the tables, and the big bopper blaring from the overhead speakers. You are transported back to a time when a gallon of gas cost $.18c , and life seemed...well, cheaper.\n",

We had heard that kids loved this place, but the only comment our kids had was \"why does everything look so old here?\"  I'm not quite sure whether they were talking about the decor or the clientele (lots of elderly, some kids, very little in-between).  They did like the paper hats and the hulu-hoop rack outside though.\n",
      "Burgers ['Burgers', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Restaurants', 'Desserts', 'American (Traditional)', 'Food'] Service was lacking!! Took forever for her to take our order. \n",

      "Burgers ['Burgers', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Restaurants', 'Desserts', 'American (Traditional)', 'Food'] One of the worst restaurants in Scottsdale. New owners need to take a look at the food.

      "Burgers ['Burgers', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Restaurants', 'Desserts', 'American (Traditional)', 'Food'] Was in the mood for breakfast at lunchtime, so I dropped by this location.

The Omelet was cooked well, not runny....which is a good thing.  The only thing I didn't like about the Omelet was the Mushrooms....they were definitely canned and not cut fresh...other than that, it was a solid Omelet.\n",

The once tender flavorful turkey dinner has now been replaced with slices of cheap, chopped, pressed and formed, processed lunch meat. The stuffing is a bland mush, and the small piece of corn on the cob was microwaved to the point of no return, rubbery and nasty. The kitchen is still staffed by people who are challenged where the English language is concerned, and the replacement meal was just as bad as the original one I sent back. NEVER AGAIN 5&Diner!\n",
      "Burgers ['Burgers', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Restaurants', 'Desserts', 'American (Traditional)', 'Food'] Good food and a great atmosphere.  We went on a Saturday night and they had a balloon artist who made all sorts of great creations for the kids, even a balloon rainbow! The staff seemed a little overwhelmed, but they were very polite. The milkshakes are excellent and you can choose from many flavors (the peanut butter was awesome).\n",

They hook it up too by that they give you the shake, plus the leftovers in the metal shake container.  So its like 2 shakes in one.

My daughter, husband, grandson and I all visited this location on a Saturday afternoon at around 2 P.M. We were seated quickly, but were not greeted by a waitress until at least 10 minutes later. Our order was taken, and it took around 30 minutes for the food to arrive. The grown ups ordered the Hound Dogs with Fries and for the little guy it was the chicken nuggets and fries. When the food arrived the hot dogs were luke warm and the fries appeared undercooked and greasy. The hot dog bun was cooked to the point of being super crunchy ugh! As for the chicken nuggets... WAY overdone and not tasty at all. We should have sent all of the food back, but were hungry and frustrated by the time it came to our table. We all ate about half our food and left the rest for the trash. The only reason it even earned 2 stars is for the atmosphere and nostalgia.\n",
      "Burgers ['Burgers', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Restaurants', 'Desserts', 'American (Traditional)', 'Food'] I keep wanting to like this place.  Over priced food.  Dirty.  Last summer guy sweating like a pig leaning over the ice cream maker to make my shake.  Today  roach ran across the counter, ended my breakfast.  Not to mention the place is just plain dirty.  Place could be so much more.\n",
      "Burgers ['Burgers', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Restaurants', 'Desserts', 'American (Traditional)', 'Food'] I really dig this place.  If you want classic American diner fare, this is where to go.   It's cheap.  It's fast. The portions are large.   And it's pretty tasty.   I highly recommend the grilled chicken sandwich and the steak and eggs breakfast.   They have a real grill.  The food has grillmarks!  Score!    If you want fancy, smancy food, this place will not appeal to you. It's the same food you could get at IHOP or Denny's, but a lot better.\n",
      "Burgers ['Burgers', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Restaurants', 'Desserts', 'American (Traditional)', 'Food'] I found the service a bit slow in bringing the check and running my card, but that is my only bad complaint.  This is a kid-friendly place to eat and they have a lot of good choices for everyone.  I am addicted to the albacore tuna melt; however, my niece's sourdough french toast looked really good too.

In fact, the other day I was told a good chef in Memphis (whose restaurants is allegedly not doing well) commented he would *never* put a burger on his menu. That's a really silly idea. There are people like me who travel for work and check yelp for a great local burger. People like me read reviews of good burgers and then travel specifically to the restaurant for the burger. Which of course adds to revenues and grows business.\n",

Our server was professional and nice and our dinners arrived quickly and looked great. I had the pot roast w/whipped potatoes and my husband had the Papperdelle Pasta w rib tips. We shared and I have to say the Papperdelle wins. The sauce is delectable, the noodles cooked perfectly. I can't wait to come back for this!

      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I have so many mixed feelings about meat & potatoes. The food is excellent. The decor is beautiful. The seating is the most comfortable ever. the tables along the right hand side are very intimate..if you want to get to know your table neighbs. The deals on Monday night are fabulous--$5 gourmet burgers, $3 fries and many other options. The brunch and Bloody Mary bar are to die for. But the music and ambience, the patrons... all make me very uncomfortable. I'd rather listen to dinner music than listen to a dj spin techno over breakfast or while having a late night meal.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Absolutely wonderful! Went here with a friend, shared fried pickles, she got the Plain Jane burger and I got the Three Little Pigs sandwich, and everything was delicious! My sandwich had what I believe was bacon, ham, and some kind of fried pork on it with swiss and an egg over easy on huge grilled bread, and it was incredible! The fried egg really made the sandwich. The fired pickles came with some kind of spicy ranch sauce, and they were great- seasoned well, thick, and a great portion to share for two for only $5. Totally recommend!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I went with my boyfriend and another couple for brunch recently. Bloody mary bar was awesome (there were so many options for toppings), you are able to pick your liquor and then go to the bar and add whatever you would like which makes it fun. The food was great and our table had a great view and was spacious. The server seemed to be either hungover or that he did not want to be there. Other than the service, everything was amazing and we will be back!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] A really neat dining experience, esp. when ordering the giant rib eye on the bone.  It was cooked to perfection, tasted awesome and the muscles with tomatoe were the perfect appetizer.  We couldn't quit sopping up the sauce with garlic toast and I enjoyed my dining experience, very much, here!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Great place! Fast and friendly service! Food is amazing! The steak was rich and cooked perfectly and the potatoes were confit and the best I HAVE EVER HAD! Marrow bone was a tasty addition. The atmosphere is spacious yet feels cozy. Give it a try!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Excellent food! We had the bone marrow appetizer, my husband had the super generous sized three pigs sandwich, while I dined on the hanger steak special. Great flavors, well cooked, good presentation, and great service. Only dock a point because our table was only inches away from the other tables on either side of us which really distracts from the experience. All we heard was the conversation taking place next to us rather than each other. Great place - just need a bit more space!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Always great.  Was surprised that they ran out of the big steak on a Sunday night.   Service is always great and the bone marrow is off the charts.  Chicken livers are also a favorite.   I did notice that they have now made the steak more ala carte, not that you needed the potatoes but the sauce was nice.  My kids love it and it's always on our list when we visit.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Exceptional meals. Already a family favorite.

      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I love meat and potatoes most times I go. The service can be hit or miss. When it's hit, it's the best restaurant experience. When it's miss, you wonder why your bill is so high! I absolutely enjoy every bite of food I have here!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] This restaurant was ok. The macaroni and cheese wasn't the best I have ever had but the environment was very nice.  I think I may have just ordered the wrong thing. I had the pot roast and while it was tender the flavor was a little off for my taste.  Great location for a fun night out with friends.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Personally I think this restaurant is overrated.  The seats are all very close together and I had people bumping into me as they were trying to pass by my seat and the bar.  Also, since its always busy, its very loud.  The cocktails are very good, but expensive and small.  I had a good meal and the service was prompt, but I just don't know if this place is as good as everyone is making it out to be.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I give Meat & Potatoes 3 stars simply because of the small atmosphere and smaller tables. If possible, I'd give the food a 4 star rating alone but, you gotta take everything into consideration when dining at a restaurant! \n",

We had the Irish Benedict and the Brisket & Kimchi. My boyfriend and I shared. We literally could not decide which one was better. Service was great, always attentive and never pushy. We started with the Bloody Mary bar. It was very interesting but I don't think I know how to make a Bloody Mary as a good as a bar tender. But a great idea in theory. Also, they are only $5, can't beat that. As for the other libations, spectacular! Especially the Irish breakfast! I'm already planning my next visit!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] What a great place. Amazing food, awesome bartenders.

      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Our family had dinner here before a Pirates game last night.  We had been looking forward to eating here after reading many positive reviews.  The service was excellent and the drinks were good.  Our kids both had Mac & Cheese with the pulled pork (no chorizo) and it was ok, but too much cheese for the mac, and the pork did not work well with it.  My husband had the Korean Reuben, and he said it was way too salty, as were the fries.  He also said the pungency of the kimchee overwhelmed the sandwich, and he couldn't taste any of the other flavors.  I had the fish and chips and they were awesome.  The fish was skate, and it was really delicious - lightly breaded and fried, but not greasy.  The taste of the fish dominated, and that was a good thing.  The chips followed the theme of being too salty.  Overall, it was disappointing.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] This is probably the only bar in Pittsburgh that can make a proper Last Word, not to mention that they have a couple of barrel-aged cocktails on the menu (Manhattan, Negroni).  Nice program, wasn't expecting to find that out here.  \n",
      "\n",

      "- Fish-n-Chips (fried skate)\n",
      "\n",
      "The burgers, sandwiches, and fish and chips were all great, but damn the portions were big.  If Jon Taffer ever came to this place he would say that the food costs are probably out of control.  An upscale place like this should be serving share plates like sliders, not giant deli sandwiches.  I can't complain about them for giving lots of food to us, it may be that they have to do that to compete for local business for all I know.  Just saying that I would have preferred more small plate options.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Oh my goodness!  This place was amazing.  Everything we ordered was fantastic!  I highly recommend the Brussel sprouts,  the goat cheese & bread,  as well as the pork sandwich.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] The atmosphere here is so cool!  The drinks are excellent and the food is even better. I've ordered the black bass on one occasion and the agnolotti on another.  Both dishes were the perfect size and were loaded with flavor! My favorite appetizer is the bone marrow.  Before visiting meat & potatoes I had never tried bone marrow before, but since then I've tried it at several other restaurants around the country and none have measured up to meat & potatoes.  My only complaint is that the tables are very close together, so I felt like the neighboring tables were listening to my conversations and I felt like I was eavesdropping on theirs.  An excellent pre-show dinner option for sure!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] The dinner menu is limited and, in my opinion, somewhat overpriced. Well known for its fancy cocktails. The name seems a misnomer because the dishes are prepared with some \"creativity\" which generally work but seem an end unto themselves by being different than standard.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Very unusual menu- make sure to review it before going. \n",

      "As others have stated, it is rather noisy and tables are right on top of each other.  Also the lighting is very dim, which makes it difficult to see the presentation of meals as they pass by to help you decide what to order. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing I'd recommend, because it looked so good, was the 34 oz. Ribeye for 2 - it truly looked like something out of the Flintstones, and will leave you plenty of leftovers to take home.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] The food was great, but the service was iffy. I ordered the chicken and waffles, and it was delicious, but very filling, as are many of the dishes. The service was very slow, however.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I made my reservation for Meat and Potatoes a couple months in advance and they were more than accommodating when I had called two additional times to make it larger. So, I was really happy with their customer service from the get go. \n",

      "We arrived 15 minutes before our 10:30 pm reservation and were seated exactly on time. I was hoping that since was later in the evening that we'd get seated earlier, but the place was actually still very packed. \n",
      "\n",
      "The hostess seated us at a table with very plush, tufted dining chairs and a beautiful wood table. (I immediately had dining room envy.) The menu gave you choices, but it wasn't overwhelming. However, there were so many different things that we wanted to try for starters, but we settled on the Mac and Cheese, Fried Taters, and the Smoked Buffalo Wings. My plan was to focus on the Smoked Buffalo wings and the fries, due to the breakup that my digestion system had with lactose a few years ago. For my main dish, I ordered the Waygu Flatiron Steak because, I mean, this place was probably named \"Meat and Potatoes\" for a reason. \n",

Even though I was hungry,  I couldn't help but wonder how we'd even finish half of it.  That worry was quickly erased. I began shoveling french fries into my mouth. And, after I saw my sister break the crust on the steaming pile of corkscrew noodles drenched in creamy cheesiness, the plans to forgo the Mac and Cheese were quickly forgotten. \n",
      "\n",
      "Everything was OUT OF CONTROL good. The wings were an amazing ratio of saucy to crispy. And, there was a perfect smokiness to the wing sauce. I would venture to say that they were the best that I have ever had. The mac and cheese was uniquely divine and set a new standard for the cheese pasta dish. The fries were perfect crisp and seasoned.  Potatoes were never done better justice. \n",

The steak has become what I would want for my last meal on Earth. The mashed potatoes weren't my favorite. The consistency was a bit stiff and the wasabi was off putting when contrasted with the other flavors in the dish. \n",

      "We were too gorged to even consider dessert, but we did get the pumpkin cheesecake to go. It is served a cute little mason jar with a few raspberries on top. (I hate raspberries, but we'll forgive them this one offense.) This dessert was light and delicious. And, should probably be incorporated into my Thanksgiving menu. I'm just sayin'.\n",

Go with more adventurous eaters so that they are game for the marrow. Don't miss it. My only gripe is that it's a bit dark...like people using their cell phones to read the menu dark but I guess it's a plus if your blind date turns out to be less than thrilling.\n",

The ambiance was nice, a little too loud for my taste for dinner but that is expected in a gastropub. Our waitress explained the daily specials in detail and was very attentive throughout our dinner. \n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered fried pickles as a snack and meat & potatoes for 2 as the main dish. I'm glad that was all we ordered because that main dish was humongous. Fried pickles were delicious, very light and crisp. And the main dish was awesome too, cooked just as we wanted and came with delicious mushrooms and potatoes (as the name suggests).\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason for 4 stars is because we weren't informed that our main dish would take an hour to prepare and our wait for our food got a little anxious towards the end like \"did they forget about us?\" etc. Other than that it was a very smooth experience.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Having been to Meat & Potatoes countless times, I recently revisited for the first time in over a year and was delighted to see that it hasn't missed a beat, despite the fact that the ownership has continued to add more hip restaurants/bars to its repertoire. The cocktails are still awesome. There's still an interesting beer list, a few of which are draft, but most of which is entirely in cans. The menu continues to change every so often and offer some great items including the mussels, which seem to have become a mainstay there, a mushroom risotto (awesome though a bit heavy on the parsley) and a pickled chicken sandwich with bread + butter pickles, garlic mayo and iceberg lettuce, which was just freakin' delicious! On an earlier occasion a while back, I had a beef sandwich that was a daily special and was about the best beef sandwich that I've ever had! While I find the atmosphere to be too modern and contrived to be called a gastropub as they call themselves, it's fun and lively. It has a speakeasy feel to it, though it's very open and visible, so it's more like a speakeasy that came out of the closet. The service was decent. Bonus points for the kitchen being open until midnight on Fridays and Saturdays.\n",

The saffron and beer mussels...wonderful.  My friend had the pork chop....he said it was the best one he's ever had...he cleaned that puppy down to the bone.  The Gin Richard drink....amazing.

      "At 1030pm, there was still a 20 minute wait so we started with a drink at the bar. The whole establishment feels like a bourbon bar/speakeasy, and is unlike any other place we've ever been. While enjoying a drink at the bar, all three bartenders engaged us in conversation and made us feel right at home. We decided to order just a few small plates and eat at the bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "We started with a short rib flatbread that was very unique and delicious. Next came the Devils on horseback. Being from Baltimore, we are accustomed to oysters, however these were served with dates. They were a little heavy for our taste, but very flavorful. The standout dish was their fried brussel sprouts. They were so crispy and crunchy, but still had their earthy sort of flavor. I would come back just for an order of those. The bartenders were also making gourmet cocktails with ingredients I had never even heard of. The speed well was right in front of us so we got to smell all of the drinks as they were being made. \n",

      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Meat & Potatoes was a blast. Arrived w/o a reservation on a Saturday night and even though we were told we would not get a table for another 1.5-2 hours we could find seats at the bar. We found one for the two of us (of course) but decided to stake our territory anyway with the one chair and to grab another when one freed up, which took some waiting and work including dealing with a rude old man...\n",

      "Aside from that I love the dark interior of M & P with the mirrors and gold trim surrounding the room. It adds a nice element of elegant coziness. \n",

      "The bartenders greeted us and were kind enough to give us a sample of the beers we were interested in trying. Ordered the Oscar and my bf ordered the Kobe Flat Iron. Oscar had a cut of veal, a fried soft shell crab on top and a side of risotto. Delicious - kind of on the salty side but I like it that way. I ate every bite but I had a hard time cutting with the knives they gave me (first butter knife then was given a steak knife when realized I was cutting with a butter knife). And the service continued to be great - the bartenders checked in periodically, were friendly and didn't push you out of  M & P. They let you soak in the experience and we did.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Amazing food. Great beer. Can host a business dinner or a date night. Prepare your carnivorous desires and stay a while for the atmosphere.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] great time here.  bone marrow is really good.  not as many meat options as you would think, they don't have any steaks.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Fun atmosphere and a great beer list. There was a wait when we arrived and we sat at the bar and ordered a Bloody Mary and a snack. The food came before the drinks, no big deal. The Bloodies were watered down Tomatoe Juice $9 each = big deal. We were never offered a table even though we put our name in. Disapointing first visit.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Great atmosphere, top notch service and some of the best cocktails I've had in years.

Make sure you don't sit in the back room though, it has a very strange cold atmosphere.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Fantastic joint located in the Cultural District of Pittsburgh's Downtown area. I admit, I'm surprised that I put off coming to this place for so long. My friend and I ended up splitting a Meat & Potatoes for Two ($69), which included a 34 oz. ribeye steak meat cooked medium rare, confit steak fries, mushroom ragu, homemade steak sauce, and bone marrow gratin. I also ended up getting a devils on horseback as a small plate. Let's start with the main entree ... the steak meat for the ribeye was dope. Not only very tender, but also very flavorful especially with the homemade steak sauce, which gave the meat a more tangy flavor. Quantity of meat was abundant and even for two, it took my friend and I the entire meal to eat all that meat up. The confit steak fries were also not your average steak fries ... not soggy, but very crisp and tasty with seasoning (much appreciated). The bone marrow tasted like fat ... not sure if this is how it should taste (as this is the first time I've ever had anything like it), but it was very interesting indeed and I used it to coat a few of the steak fries that I ate. The mushroom ragu was great. Fresh, firm, and flavorful. The devils on horseback was tasty ... came in a small tray and I only got three. Not sure if the price on it was justified, but the taste was good. In general, a great place to go. Just go hungry and ready to eat meat!\n",

We got there and Mike just said he had the best seat in the house for us and would be right back after the 'final preparations.' That was the politest way we've ever heard someone leave to move a chair without making a big deal out of it.

      "The draught selection was on the small side, but they had a super random selection of cans and bottles. It's been a few years since I've lived out east so it was fun to try some new beer. They had an elaborate bar but we weren't able to take advantage of all that.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, great. Host, waitress, food, drinks... I have no idea when I'll be in Pittsburgh again but I would definitely go out of my way if I was in town!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] The drinks were great. Tartare and steak were off the chain. Velvet cake was delicious. Definitely want to come back. Pittsburgh you rocked all around\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Note: By ALL means, make a reservation. A few months ago, we were turned away because we didn't have one.  \n",

      "It was a harrowing journey from Kay's Beaver Falls lovenest to Downtown Pittsburgh for my belated birthday date with culinary destiny: Meat & Potatoes. A fender bender on Route 60 did not deter us nor did the frigid temperatures. I was meant to come here, yesterday, not moons before, and we made it just in time. A phone call Kay made en route to M&P explaining that we might be late was unnecessary even though they promised to hold our table for another 30 minutes. They also knew we were meant to dine here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emily, our ornately tattooed server who went up, away, and beyond her call of duty to make this a gastronomic night of nights, knew we were meant to come here against all adversity. The glitter in her bespectacled eyes and her pixieish demeanor were simultaneously homey, reassuring ('don't worry, ya made it! i promise it'll rule!'), and magically stirring, as if she was a riot grrl/food fairy/carnival barker leading us onto a rollercoaster of protein, starch, and housemade opulence. The restaurant was dark like a theater, a theater of madness, wonder...\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe, she wanted to test us, test...me. She saw me coming, months ago, I swear...in a crystal ball...\n",
      "\n",
      "A ternion of Devils On Horseback charged towards us with flag-like skewers jutting from their armadillo backs. Honeyed, bacon-wrapped, armored like hellborne beetles, full of chorizo sausage, manchego cheese, and topped with peppers, onions, and a red sauce reminiscent of ketchup that I cannot recall the name of, I finished off two, Kay dispatched one.\n",
      "\n",
      "After quickly shellacking our first appetizer, I inspected my surroundings. Dish rags were napkins. Mason jars held food, candles. Water was poured from glass milk bottles. A large bar in the center of the room came off as a carousel for cackling, well-to-do adults who wanted very much to be seen. In what was a demonic, Dickensian Coney Island for carnivores and time-travelers, Kay and I just tried to survive in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second appetizer came in the form of Pate, as M&P calls it. A duck liver mucilage is topped off with a sauternes jam in a sealed jar and served with toasted, grainy bread and a spreading knife. A rare treat, we rationed it, swaying with each gloriously silken, subtly sweet, crunchy bite. \n",
      "\n",
      "Knowing that they must grind their own beef, I was compelled to try the Pub Burger, or was it compelled to try...me? The imperious fried egg was the first thing I saw followed by the flaky, buttery bun and the horseradish cheddar flap. The trembling, fat pastrami pork belly slab became noticeable only after the initial chomp. A \"special sauce\" lurked...somewhere within. Magnificently frizzled and exotically seasoned \"fried taters\" sat off to the side in a steaming heap. These are also offered as a \"snack\" with truffle mayonnaise, but when I asked to have the truffle mayonnaise, Emily gladly obliged for an upcharge. The beef, egg, cheese, and pastrami all colluded to create a creamy-meets-meaty alchemy for my mouth, and I savored it in lieu of attacking it. This was more than a burger; this was a game of chess, the crowning french fries and the exquisite truffle mayo acting as a respite between moves unti...checkmate! \n",
      "\n",
      "Kay had a pot full of mussels that were likely the greatest and freshest of all the mussels ever noshed on. Arriving at an ideal consistency between gummy, gamey, and tender, the mussels soaked in a intoxicatingly beery brine that begged to be absorbed by our bread and were chaperoned by plump cubes of a bacon packed with flavors that were at once earthy and unearthly. Clearly, this was not bacon from a supermarket cooler. \n",
      "\n",
      "We almost ordered dessert. That was until Kay said with a playful look in her eye, \"You know you want that marrow. Order it. It's your night.\" Emily approved, laughing as she headed back to the kitchen as if aloft on butterfly wings, likely saying in her head, \"Man, these groovy folks GET it!\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Out came three bones colossal enough to have come from wyverns along with cups of gremolata, pearl onions, capers, sea salt, and more bread. With this dish, we danced on the edge of de trop, the filthy rich jellied lard nearly overwhelming us. It has been called \"God's Butter.\" After last night, I shall call it \"Satan's Tallow.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, dessert arrived in a dyad of mason jars. One was Red Velvet Cake, complete with a lone candle to commemorate my birthday. The other was a chocolate mousse so iniquitous, so profoundly profane in its sugariness, I coveted it, longing to snatch it from Kay's hands. Not even a cap of whipped cream was enough to cut its carnal cocoa essence. The Red Velvet held its own, however, its batter bright red and moist, its cream cheese icing adding angelic vim in an attempt to offer salvation from tawny, aerated damnation. Thus ended our ride and trial. It did not kill us. We are now stronger.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I have eaten at Meat & Potatoes for both Brunch & Dinner. The restaurant serves delicious meals, great drinks and a friendly wait staff. \n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant can get extremely busy, especially before a show in one of the nearby theaters. I would definitely recommend booking a reservation in advance, as you will not get seated without one during busy hours. \n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant has a dark atmosphere and a few of the tables are very close together, making it difficult to hold a conversation with all of the noise. I have found that it is better to eat at Meat & Potatoes will a group of friends or family, as you will get seated on the side of the restaurant that is less crowded. \n",
      "\n",
      "Further, the restaurant has a private party room that can accommodate a large group of people for any event. \n",
      "\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] The food and atmosphere of Meat and Potatoes was awesome! I had the Plain Jane Burger, and my boyfriend had the Brisket Sandwich. Both were delicious and cooked to perfection. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're in Pittsburgh!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I have been all over the world and this is one of the top dining experiences ever!  \n",

      "Apps:  pimento cheese, Brussels sprouts and pigs ears are AWESOME!\n",
      "\n",
      "Every entree ordered was awesome!  The Pub Burger is the BEST burger I have ever had!  Smoked Pork Chop with bone marrow reduction was incredible! And their collard greens are the best ever (and I am from the south!). \n",
      "What a great experience and will go there every time I am in Pittsburgh.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Place is beyond delicious. Had the mushroom risotto and could have eaten a million more servings of it. Went with a group of people and no one left hungry or disappointed. If you are in Pittsburgh you must try!!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] During my first real visit to Pittsburgh I had the joy of sitting down to a meal at Meat & Potatoes- being from Philadelphia people have a lot of bad things to say about Pittsburgh (not sure why, probably because we're just mean), but the meal I had here did many things to break down these rumors and start me toward thinking that Pittsburgh could be an awesome place. \n",
      "\n",
      "The waitress we had was super attentive and friendly and any place that serves things in jars basically has me hooked from the onset. As for the food, I tried the tacos and mac n cheese simply because I was having serious trouble deciding and just randomly picked, and I was not disappointed with my choice. The mixture of meat/bbq sauce/apple slaw creates quite the mouth-gasm upon eating. and the mac N cheese was so rich I had to take half of it home- it was simply too great. I suppose my only complaint might be that the neighboring table (and perhaps my dinner companion) might have heard my moderately audible moans. whoops. so impolite. but moving on...\n",
      "\n",
      "Being that I've only been here once I can't quite give them a 5 star rating only because I think I'd need to eat another meal here, but from what I've tried I can certainly say they've got my attention, and I would certainly repeat my visit to try all the other delights they have to offer.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] My girlfriend and I went here after we saw a show downtown. I had heard great things about M&P and was super excited. However, I was pretty disappointed with my experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got the lamb burger and my girlfriend got the duck.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lamb burger was not good. I thought the meat was spongy and didn't taste fresh. I was pretty sad, since I was expecting to be blown away.\n",
      "\n",
      "The duck, however, was delicious. It was very well cooked. The skin was nice and crispy and the meat was tender. The plate came in three parts on a long plate. A salad, pierogies, and the duck. The flavors from each were good on their own, but to me, they felt like three separate dishes. I didn't feel any unifying theme between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps it was my fault that I didn't get the steak. I think I will try again someday in the future.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] In the past month I've had dinner twice there and the food was more impressive each time. The duck breast is amazing. Then I had the pork chop. OMG is was a double bone chop, like having your own personal mini ham. And the sides, Jesus if I lived here I'd be the size of the blimp. O and throw in poutine for an app, the best I've ever had.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I took a group here and we all were very satisfied with our food. My wife had the chicken and said it was exceptional. My daughter had the porch chop and it was HUGE and she loved it. Her boyfriend had the duck and he also loved it. Oh...and we had an order of mac and cheese which may have been some of the best mac and cheese that I have ever had. I usually don't like it when they doctor up mac and cheese with fancy stuff....but this time it worked. Why 4 instead of 5 stars? I had the pot roast and while it was good, it was tough. Good flavor but a few places it was too tough to eat. But, I would go back and just not order the pot roast.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Once again, another wonderful experience at Meat & Potatoes!  With tickets to an 8 PM show, we arrived for our 5:45 PM reservation and were seated immediately.  Our server, Adam, introduced himself quickly and was very good throughout the meal of stopping to fill water glasses and check in, without being intrusive or making us feel rushed.  If you like sours, the bar makes their own homemade sours and they are really good.  I loved my whiskey sour!  Dinner was pot roast for my friend and I had the heirloom tomato feta salad (on the specials) and the curry mussels, which were fantastic!  I love the spice and thickness of the broth, which make for delicious dipping for the garlic bread. I only wish that the tables were not quite so close to each other, but otherwise, this was a fantastic way to enjoy a girls night out for the dinner part of dinner and a show!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Unique twist on steakhouse fare. A nice atmosphere before going to a show. A bit crowded, but, that goes with the territory...\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] My favorite restaurant in town. \n",
      "\n",
      "The steak for two is one of those simple meals made elegant and perfect thronging preparation and top notch ingredients. \n",

      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] After hearing and reading raving reviews about Meat & Potatoes, I dined there expecting the best of the best.. of the best in Pittsburgh. Even though it was very tasty, it did not meet the 5-star review that I was expecting. However, I had dinner there for a work function, so I was in the back room with a round table and was away from all of the activity. For me, this took a lot away from my entire experience because I couldn't experience the atmosphere in its entirety. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let's start with the appetizers. I tried both the fried brussels and Artisinal Cheese Board. The Artisinal Cheese Board was definitely my favorite. The display was so cool, and it was definitely great for sharing. Someone in my party loved the Bone Marrow, which I wasn't feeling brave enough to try (maybe next time?). The Waldorf salad was pretty tasty. A little bit on the bland side, and I was expecting a better presentation, but overall, I would order the salad again. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the main course, I ordered the Wagyu Flat Iron. I order my meat medium well, and it was a little pinker than I had hoped, but it was still pretty good. And, the serving was huge! I was definitely not expecting as big of a steak...enormous actually.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dessert...delicious. It seemed like they had seasonal offerings, and I had the gingerbread cake, which was my favorite part of the meal. Again, huge piece of cake.  Oh, and cocktails...my party seemed to enjoy what they had. The bar was hopping.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've tried to make reservations for this place a few times and it's been booked. Book in advance, and on a Friday or Saturday night, don't expect to walk in and get a table without a reservation, especially because this place is located right in the heart of the Theater District. It's also loud, so don't expect to come here and have a peaceful, quiet dinner...I prefer atmospheres like this one though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I would recommend Meat & Potatoes, especially because of its location. It is not your traditional place by any means.  The menu is not ginormous, but it has your fair share of unique offerings. For what they offer, the prices are what you would expect and not outrageous either. For Pittsburgh, it is definitely a place that really stands out and has a more creative, chic take on things.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Went here for dinner and really enjoyed it.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Stopped in last weekend on Valentine's day. Great atmosphere and service. Took a tour of the menu starting with the fried pickles, taters, and bread. Got the dark n stormy off the cocktail list. Everything was fantastic - on par with it's sister restaurants.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Very interesting menu.\n",

      "Very nice modern atmosphere.\n",
      "Hot young professionals like to hang out here.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Very chill place to have a great brunch! Chicken and waffles were amazing!!! Sweet with a hit of spice! Juicy chicken! Big portion. Bread with rhubarb jam and goat butter was awesome!!! Great music!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Not all components of the meal were impressive, but I really enjoyed the specials that they had the particular evening we went: Squid Ink Pasta and Steak and Frites. \n",
      "The Squid Ink Pasta had a great texture and chew to it, and none of the \"seafood-y\" taste, smell, or grittiness. Lots of fresh seafood and a great tomato sauce to finish! Very impressed.\n",
      "I thought that the Steak and Frites would be your typical thinnish-strip steak, but the steak we received was thick, cooked perfectly, and super tender. The frites were very, very salty.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also tried the Bone Marrow (described at \"meat butter\") by the staff, and it came with grilled bread, gremolata and pickled onions. It was a bit too fatty and greasy for me, and I wasn't a particular fan, but I had to try it since I was there.\n",
      "The Fried Brussel Sprouts were less impressive- super salty and the sprout leaves weren't that crisp as I've seen at some other restaurants. Lemon aioli was good. \n",
      "The Smoked Brisket Mac and Cheese was fine- nothing particularly stood out to me, and if I were to return, I would try something else. \n",
      "\n",
      "In general, service was fine. We enjoyed the Squid Ink Pasta and Steak and Frites, though they are not on the regular menu. Overall, a lot of the dishes were on the salty side.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Having been to Meat & Potatoes at least ten times now, I've had some really amazing meals here, definitely worthy of 5 stars. But I also think things can be a bit inconsistent here. Although it's definitely one of my favorite spots in the 'burgh, it's just short of perfection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just like everyone else in the world, I love love love the ambiance here. I find the chairs a little uncomfortable (probably because I'm short and can't reach the table...I should really consider bringing a booster seat) but other than that, everything is gorgeous speakeasy chic and is a good match for the upscale comfort food theme. It also has a great vibe for some classy drinking, and I'd certainly visit the bar more often if I had the $$$\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, in love with the brunch. I really do think this is the best brunch in the city. The shortrib hash and the korean brisket & eggs are my favorite dishes, and who can resist a $5 DIY bloody mary bar with house-infused vodkas in flavors like bacon and shallot?? I know I can't...though I wish I could so I could try the various flavors of bellini they offer. If you only eat one brunch in Pittsburgh, this is the one you want to try.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dinner is where I've had some mixed experiences. The steaks and other mains are usually awesome. The mussels have been less impressive, and on the last visit I ordered a version with \"balsamic pearls\" that I expected to mimic the texture of the salmon roe in the dish. Instead there were just clumps of chewy, stale-tasting balsamic vinegar interspersed among the shells. Something is also off in their steak tartare, and trust me...I LOVE tartare. I just think the flavors they choose in trying to be creative don't always work in harmony. But the simple things, the \"meat and potatoes\" if you will, are done wonderfully, and that's what you should come here for.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] A friend and I popped in to Meat & Potatoes for brunch on Saturday and ended up having one of the best meals / food experiences of my life!  We didn't have reservations, but they were able to comfortably accommodate us at the bar.  We had some of their specialty cocktails, which were all expertly mixed, aesthetically appealing, and delicious.  For brunch, I had the chicken and waffles and my friend had the flatbread salmon, both from the regular menu.  The chicken was quite possibly the best fried chicken I've ever had, and my friend's flatbread lox was so fresh and delicious.  The atmosphere was interesting and trendy without being uncomfortable, and the service was good as well as friendly.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the waitstaff and bartenders all seemed to be enjoying their work, which always speaks volumes to me about they way an eating establishment is run.\n",
      "\n",
      "I highly recommend Meat & Potatoes to anyone looking for a fun dining experience with original food ideas executed perfectly.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I'll start off with the bad. Had to take away 1 star due to the host. She was not friendly. I came in with a friend with no reservation because there were no more available when I tried to make one online. The host took my name down and said she'd call me if there were any cancellations. So basically telling me I wasn't getting a table if no one cancelled. But she quoted another party of two that came in after me 20mins. Unacceptable. Not sure what her deal was. I asked to speak with a manager and told him the situation. He sat us right away. I wish I could remember our servers name because he went above and beyond to take care of us. I had the croque madame. I've had better but it was good. The French toast was to die for. I will fly back just for that French toast and I live in California. Overall I had an amazing experience. Great cocktails great food. I'll be back next time I'm in town.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] It was very good, but coming from NY, still think Lugers is better.  We ordered the steak for two.  Was not aware that everything's a la cart, including the steak sauces.  One off my check list.  I would still go back if in Pittsburgh again.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] We had visited another restaurant owned by the same group previously, and loved it, so we had high hopes for this place to. Most of the food was pretty tasty and service was attentive. We started with cocktails and crispy pork ears served with quick pickles. The ears were nice and crunchy - more like crispy bacon than some other places I've tried them. We also had the poutine which much like American poutine in general does hold up to its Canadian counterpart. But if you haven't had it in Canada, this one was okay. My one compliant is the cheese curds - there isn't enough and their consistency is such that they don't really melt. I had the buffalo two ways - buffalo steak served with buffalo sweet breads. The steak was yummy and fairly light. I usually like sweet breads, but these were maybe too big because they seemed a little too glandular for me to stomach. Plus I wasn't a fan of the buffalo sauce. If you like buffalo wings, you might enjoy this spin. We also had the bone in steak served with twice baked potatoes. It was a nice steak and a good representation for a restaurant of the same name.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] This place has been hit or miss for us. And don't order the special without asking for a price (that's a $55 mistake I've made). I really thought with the name Meat and Potatoes that the meat and potatoes would be better than they were.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Great little fusion american / pub spot.  Very swanky feel with a hipster vibe, so much so that a majority of the employees dawned thick framed eye wear and full beards.  Overall a rather small restaurant, the bar and dining area seemed rather squeezed together in a mosh posh fashion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the food was great, the chicken liver appetizer was crispy, the burgers were juicy, cooked correctly and delicious, and the brisket had an excellent smoked flavor with plenty of fat.  I gleefully approve of their use of goat cheese in a number of dishes.  The pasta dishes, however, seemed to fall a bit flat.  Dessert cheesecake was served in a cleaned out candle / mason jar, equally as tasty as it was awkward to receive.  Fries were mediocre, overly cooked and a touch salty.  Also, there could have been a larger draft beer selection. I certainly applaud them on their interesting take on a number of mildly mundane dishes though, makes for a unique dining experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prices were reasonable, the wait wasn't long, the staff was tremendously friendly and service was excellent.  Absolutely worth checking out if you're in the area.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] A native of western PA, I came back to celebrate my Mother's 76th birthday with her and told her to choose a restaurant she would not driver herself to. She picked Meat and Potatoes and I have heard of it so I was pleased to give it a try. Today, I live in the Phoenix area where a food revival has been occurring for the last decade. This prohibition themed area is comfortable and bright. The mixologists at the bar have an array of magic at their fingertips. We asked for a specialty martini for Mom that was tasty and not too strong. He whipped up a raspberry citrusy take on the cosmopolitan for her that was bright and sweet and pink and delicious. I opted for my classic Belvedere martini with bleu cheese stuffed olives. Mom chose the duck breast and I had the lamb neck cassoulet. Both were extraordinary and huge! Luckily we chose not to have an appetizer so we filled ourselves and sipped a delish pinot noir from our friendly server Adam. The atmosphere is light with 1970s pop music playing of Elton John, Billy Joel and James Taylor and diners were businessmen, families with kids, theater goers and young people. I recommend this meaty, comfortable take on amazing food without any reservations.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Cool trendy little spot in downtown Pittsburgh. We started with the fried brussle sprouts which were different but suprisingly good. For entrees my wife and I had the Pork chop and the chicken. The pork chop was very well prepared and definitely not recommended for someone who's not hungry as its huge. The chicken was tasteful tender and juicy. My only complaint is the round tables tend to be on the small side and can make eating slightly uncomfortable if you have more than two plates and drinks.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] First time to Meat and Potatoes restaurant and we will go back. My husband and I had the fried pickles, the salmon, and the pork and blue cheese flatbread. I am not a fan of fried pickles but said I would try one-I ended up having more. Our server asked if we were attending a show that evening and we were. Our meal was served in a timely manner.\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Enjoyed brunch here in January.  We loved the atmosphere except for the cramped tiny tables.  I don't see how a large person would navigate the seating.\n",
      "I had the chicken and waffles.  The chicken was tasty but the leg was still red near the bone.   My husband had the huevos rancheros and he wasn't a fan.  I'd love to try it again for dinner or happy hour mainly due to the atmosphere, location and interesting food options.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] What a wonderful place to take a date! It's very classy and well decorated. \n",
      "The chicken livers were amazing!!! I had the salmon for my main dish and it was filling and very tasty.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] First let me begin by saying that this place is not worth the hype.\n",
      "\n",
      "I came for a holiday dinner with a group of 7. It was evident that the server failed to put my order in as it came out 10 minutes later than everyone else. The noodles in my dish were not fully cooked, and the pasta dish was nothing to even rant about. If the courses are on the more expensive end, I would expect the quality of service and food to match the price tag. Unfortunately, this place does not.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are looking for a dinner spot downtown, there are plenty other options with much better food and less expensive.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] This place is just fantastic -  food and atmosphere. Get the bone marrow, you will NOT be sorry. The only thing I would wish to do is make it bit less noisy and crowded. Cocktails first-rate.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] We have been waiting to get a reservation here for a long time and dinner was phenomenal! I definitely splurged on the night but I have no regrets. I got a Caesar salad without the pork because the pig ears threw me off. But then I decided to get the flat iron steak and it was cooked to perfection just like cutting into butter. Lastly I got the Mexican honeybee drink to go with the lemon angel food cake for desert best choice I have ever made in my life. It is a pricey place but I will forever be going there for dinner with friends and family. It is definitely worth the wait!!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] O man.... I love the dinner menu at Meat and Potatoes, I really do, but I think the brunch is overrated. It's not nearly close to one of the best brunches I've had. I recommend skipping brunch and just doing dinner here instead.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] The brunch here is amazing and the portions are huge!!!!\n",

      "\n",
      "Definitely make reservations, but Get Your Butt here!!!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I don't usually like fancy, hyped up brunch spots but Meat & Potatoes was actually very good. My girlfriend and I shared an assortment of dishes: short rib hash, Irish benedict, carbonara, and fried taters. Everything was delicious but my absolute favorite was the carbonara. You can't go wrong when you combine creamy pasta with eggs. Yum! We also shared dessert..a white chocolate pretzel cheesecake (?) which was really good as well. Total cost for all that food was about $50. Not bad considering how popular the restaurant is and the quality of the food.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Went here for a nice dinner before a show. The bartender decided he knew girls better than we knew ourselves and insisted on making us fruity martinis rather than the dry martini we requested. Finally he agreed, and he made the two worst martinis ever. When we didn't drink them and ordered wine, he made fun of us for not liking our drinks.  He was the most annoying bartender I've ever experienced. Then our Red wine came in HOT milk glasses.  It was gross.  And the food? Mediocre is too generous of a description.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm.  Got the pappardelle pasta, would have licked the plate if it was appropriate.  My friend got a steak and cleaned her plate as well. Our server was super attentive and the atmosphere was pretty calm despite the restaurant being packed. I would go back any time!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] This place was amazing!  We went on Valentine's Day - us and another couple.  The waitress was so polite, attentive, and very knowledgable.\n",

      "The quality of food is amazing and this restaurant is extremely reasonably priced.\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] It's like the chefs at Meat and Potatoes can read my thoughts, and know all my secret food fantasies. \n",

      "The space, the food, the drinks, they just all work together perfectly. The space and design is kind of \"rustic hipster,\" if that's a thing. It works perfectly for a late dinner after the opera, or a casual meet up with friends. The menus are printed and presented in a black manila folder, and specials are written on a blackboard. The service is casual but competent. That is, you feel like your server is in on the whole concept of the place; they're invested, and they're not out of place. Everything was fresh, tasted homemade, and the portions were bigger than I anticipated. One of the best parts is that it's not expensive. We had 3 people, each with a drink, and each took home food, for ~$70 total. \n",
      "\n",
      "And they've got a brunch?? I'm just too excited for words.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Our favorite for brunch in Pittsburgh.  Great menu and even better Bloody Mary bar.  Never disappointed.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Came here on two separate occasions - once for dinner and once for drinks and appetizers. This place always seems to be packed no matter what day of the week, so be sure to make a reservation!\n",
      "\n",
      "I highly recommend the mussels of the day! The mussels were really clean and fresh, and well-prepared; didn't have a bitterness that bad mussels can have, like at the all-you-can-eat chinese buffets (bleh!).\n",
      "\n",
      "The poutine appetizer was a real disappointment. After having poutine for the first time earlier this year in Toronto, Canada, I was looking forward to see and try Meat & Potatoes' take on the dish. What ended up coming to the table looked more like wanna-be gourmet cheesy fries than actual poutine. \n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely would come back for the mussels, skipping the appetizers.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Was very much looking forward to dining at M&P after recently seeing it on I believe it was The Food Network. Happened to be in town for the Trans Siberian Orchestra concert (wonderful experience) so thought to give it a try. Reservations were for 5:30, arrived at evening opening and was seated almost immediately when they opened at 5. Provided menu and service items by a nicely interactive wait staff member. We already knew what we wanted so was able to order fairly quickly. We started with fried pickles, and for the main course ordered the $75 steak for two along with rosemary potatoes and roasted cauliflower. The waitress did warn that the size of the meat would take 45 minutes to cook which we understood and still would have plenty of time to make it to the concert. The pickles arrived very rapidly. They were okay, thickly breaded and thick cut pickles but flavor was a bit lacking (primanti brothers and Buffalo Wild Wings both do fried pickles much better). And now the wait...  Meat was horribly under cooked.  Instead of medium as ordered it arrived blue rare at best.  It was so full of myoglobin it was like it was just sliced off the animal.  After getting the waitresses attention, they offered to take it back to finish cooking, this took another 15 or so minutes and now the potatoes were cold, sadly as they were great before that.  The amount of blood and gore with the first presentation pretty much destroyed our appetites.  The waitress had the manager comp the sides.  With this experience, I can't and won't recommend the restaurant, if you do brave it, don't order this meal unless you have vampiric appetites.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Holy cow (or pig?)! This place is amazing! The atmosphere is quite hip, the food is astounding, the music selection is perfect, and the seating is probably the most comfortable restaurant seating I have ever experienced. I ordered the wagyu steak as my entree and our starters were the fried pickles, fried taters, and cheese board. It was legitimately all amazing. There are several parking garages nearby, so parking is a breeze. I will be back! This has definitely become a staple of my trips back to Pittsburgh.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I've been giving a lot of five star reviews lately, but truly on the driving vacation I was on, I managed to stumble on a bunch of really excellent stops...thanks to Yelp.\n",
      "\n",
      "Truly innovative menu and perfect execution of the dishes.  Service was outstanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommended, the bone marrow appetizer, really special.\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"pork\" on the main menu was a massive double cut, brined and smoked pork chop that was just amazing.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Interesting menu, crowded energetic bar and dining area.  Cool area.  Seemed over-hyped on here.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Amazing gastropub in downtown Pittsburgh.  We've been here for after-dinner drinks and snacks, but most recently had the opportunity to check out their brunch, which they have on Saturdays and Sundays.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a recent Sunday we tried to call ahead for reservations but were informed that they were completely booked.  However, we discovered that if you don't mind sitting at the bar, you can show up for brunch and walk right in.  We got there right at 10:30 and we had no problems.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Great atmosphere: exposed brick with a marble-top bar and old-school fixtures and weird antler-type chandeliers and things hanging on the walls, and a lot of mirrors and chalkboards where specials are written on the wall. \n",
      "\n",
      "They had many brunch specials, but we went with the Irish Benedict and the Huevos Ranchero.  The Irish Benedict had an amazing hollandaise sauce over poached eggs, corned beef, cheese and some yummy thick toast.  The Huevos Ranchero were also amazing, with a delicious tomato-chili sauce, picked onions, and black beans.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Both meals were so large that we couldn't finish them.  I also ordered the potato gratin on the side, but it was sort of meh in comparison to everything else.  \n",
      "\n",
      "And the brunch cocktails were delicious: the papaya bellini was great, but the French 76 was amazing.   They have an extensive bloody mary bar which we didn't get, but it looked really fun, with all these self-serve fixins like tons of different types of olives, asparagus, artichoke, etc. etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, great service, great atmosphere, fantastic food.  We'll be back for more Meat & Potatoes!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] The meal was delicious but our service was lacking. Our server never once checked on us until time for the bill. We had to ask to find our server to get a cocktail.  For the price service should be better.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I like Meat & Potatoes. I've been there several times but I just went for brunch, so let me write about that. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had a daily special which was the pork belly with savory oats, fruit kimchi and a fried egg. This is one of the more unusual dishes that I've tried there, and it really worked for me. The rich pork balanced well with the acid in the kimchi.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sampled some of my dining companions' choices as well and enjoyed most of their dishes. I tried the brisket flatbread, which was excellent; the eggnog French toast, which was good but didn't really excite me; and the sausage and biscuit (another daily special). That last one. Man. It was oversalted. Like: Dead Seas oversalted. It was sent back and quickly replaced with something more enjoyable. The coffee was good too. \n",
      "\n",
      "Service was good but sort of... hover-y. Plates were removed from the table as soon as the last bite was consumed (or prior to in one case) . Almost all the serving staff has an earpiece which gives the place a bit of a Secret Service feel---not the most relaxing vibe for a lazy Saturday brunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will definitely be back.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Brunch here was a real treat! 5 friends and I decided to treat ourselves as late semester pick me up and it couldn't have been much better.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a reservation (highly recommended, as the space is small and popular) and were seated relatively quickly. We each ordered something different and passed plates:\n",
      "\n",
      "-Brisket and Eggs: Delicious, the meat was a little tough, but the kimchi made up for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "-Irish Benedict: Hearty but a bit bland. It also was really heavy. Definitely the least favorite.\n",
      "\n",
      "-Short Rib Hash: Pretty good, is a somewhat small portion but apparently was filling\n",
      "\n",
      "-French Toast: Absolute perfection. It was a bit sweet but all of the flavors worked well together.\n",
      "\n",
      "-Omelet Special (Sundried Tomato, Cheese Curds, Roast Beef)-Pretty good, but the real star was the potato gratin that came on the side. That was divine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We also decided to share 3 desserts. They were small so it worked out:\n",
      "\n",
      "-Black Bottom Chocolate Pecan: The presentation was awesome-it came in a jar with whipped cream on top! It was really warm and rich. Definitely delicious, but probably couldn't have eaten one by myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "-Pumpkin Tarte with Cranberry Sauce-Yum! Very festive and not too heavy. It was also less sweet which was pretty good considering the other 2 desserts.\n",
      "\n",
      "-Mudslide Tiramisu: Light, flavorful and just great. This was probably the table's favorite. I would definitely order this again, no matter the time of the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, Meat and Potatoes was a delicious treat, and  I hope to go back soon!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Wow!  If you are a committed carnivore, this is the place for you.  We had a party of five on a Saturday night at 9:00 pm.  Place was full.  Ordered for appetizers the kobe corn dog, devil on horseback, fried pickles and fried brussel sprouts (when you have to have vegetables, fry it out. :-)). The fried brussel spouts were really good, and would definitely reorder every time I'm here.  Fried pickles were also tasty, but would have probably preferred a thinner cut. Kobe corn dog was also delicious, but if you are planning to order a large entree (see below) this will fill you up too much.  The Devil on Horseback which is a date stuffed with manchego cheese and wrapped in bacon was also excellent, but the fried brussel sprouts were my favorite   Leaves were nice and crunchy, nicely salted,  awesome.  Now, for the entree, we ordered two  steak for two entrees for the five of us.  That's 34 oz of a tomahawk ribeye, with bone marrow gratin and steak fries.  This place knows how to cook steak, and that is an understatement.  Our steak was a perfect medium rare with a nice outside char.  It was topped with a mushroom sauce with huge pieces of mushrooms. The meat was so tender, you could cut it with a butter knife.  The bone marrow gratin was so rich, but the crunchy breadcrumb topping was a beautiful offset.   And the amazing thing to top it all off, was that dinner was less than $40 per person with wine and drinks.  I come from NY, and that is just not possible in the Big Apple.  You go to a great steakhouse in NY,and plan to spend three times that amount for five people.   We like to visit Pittsburgh because it's a great city with my favorite football team.  Meat & Potatoes is just another reason to take that special trip to the Steel City.  This is an awesome place!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] A friend from work highly recommended this gastropub. I am thankful for the open table app because making reservations was a breeze. We were seated immediately and everyone was surprised by how busy the restaurant was. The massive beer selection was written above the bar. My cousin and my dad ordered two appetizers for the table the bone marrow which was grilled bread, gremolata, and onion relish. The mussels of the day was the second appetizer. For our main course the guys ordered burgers, my mum ordered a salad, and I ordered the short rib flatbread pizza. The food and brews were excellent. We were all satiated and I  will be checking out meat and potatoes again!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Four of us ate the bar. The food was excellent - pub burger, pork chop, tacos and three little pigs- all nicely  prepared and yummy.  Drinks were good.  BUT - Two of three bartenders were rude, condescending, and just plain mean.  One in particular criticized our drinks choices, sneered a lot and was otherwise thought he was very cool - obviously too cool for us.  Compared to NYC bars I have been in this week, the service was much more unfriendly and haughtier here = the attitudes here make this a place I would not recommend to friends- has potential but some new staff is needed.  This experience was totally unexpected especially in Pittsburgh where most people are exceptionally nice.  Worst experience in a Pittsburgh bar- ever!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Was hyped up after eating at sister place (Butcher in the Rye). Drinks were good, food wasn't bad but was not expecting apps to be served in chachy paper carnival French fry bowls. Ambiance, drinks, food, overall experience better at Butcher\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Everything ordered was delicious, and the service was great as well. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting the Pittsburgh area.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] We were in Pittsburgh for a special occasion and decided to try Meat and Potatoes. We had a reservation and we were seated right away. I loved the atmosphere. It was pleasantly full but not crowded. No tvs at the bar which made for a lovely ambience. Our reservation was for later in the evening so the restaurant seemed to clear out with the theatre crowd. Our waiter was great, attentive without being overbearing, knew the wine list backwards and forwards and was lovely. We got the fried chicken livers and Cobb salad and then the steak for two with a chocolate dessert. All of it tasted delicious - well seasoned and generous portions on the sides. The only very minor drawback is the two top tables are very close to each other and it feels a bit like you are dining with the couple next to you. I would definitely recommend to friends who visit Pittsburgh.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Very mediocre brunch. I would give dinner 3 stars not two. I like the bar and the drinks are good, the food just doesn't quite do it for me.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Had the flat iron steak. It was cooked perfectly and the sauces and flavor of the steak were amazing!\n",
      "\n",
      "Service was good even on a crowded Friday night.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I love this place.  It's decorated beautifully and the menu is fantastic. I could probably eat nothing but their fried chicken for the rest of my life and (prematurely) die happy.  I can't say anything bad about this place AT ALL.  They also have a very good beer list featuring a lot of local selections and good cocktails.  Yum.  We generally try to squeeze in a visit to this place when we're in town visiting family.  I also think that Meat and Potatoes is far superior to Butcher and the Rye, even though I know they're essentially the same thing.  It just sort of feels like that place is a sad copy of what was already done perfectly.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Hands down one of the best brunch spots in the city!  Not only is the food great, they also have a bloody Mary bar on Sundays.  My husband jokes that he could make a meal out of the options on the bloody Mary bar.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Awesome food. We were here late and they cut our server so the service was kind of a mess. Try to make a reservation a couple days in advance at a normal dinner time and I bet you won't have any issues.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] If it was legal to marry a brunch menu in the state of Pennsylvania, I would propose to Meat & Potatoes. Instead, I will continue to live in sin with the short rib hash.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Had brunch twice. Great experience both times. Very talented staff. I ordered the chicken and waffles both times and it was delicious. The Bloody Mary bar is also fun and impressive. The ambience is also very inviting and relaxing.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Fun hipster vibe/decor.  Everything we ordered was quite salty but overall the burger and eggs benedict were tasty.  We brought our two kids under 4, which was totally doable but a bit tricky because they have no high chairs and tables are small and made of marble.  But the big booths are comfy and perfect for families or couples.  Service was quick even on busy Sunday and staff was pleasant.  Will deinitely return.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Drinks are wonderful....but the food is uneven. When it is good, it is very good...when it isn't....it isn't bad, it just lacks impact.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] We've never been here before and will never come again. We came with some beautiful young ladies to treat them to dinner and a Musical. What should have been a pleasant evening immediately became one of disrespect & ignorance. When I walked in with my daughter and her friends to get them a table I asked the hostess for a table for them & a table for myself and my husband. I was immediately told,\" we don't split parties\" and the hostess made a face of disgust at me. I then, calmly, stated to her that there would be separate checks and that she should seat our two different parties as requested. She & the young man then gave me the ugliest faces in front of my daughter and her friends. When I asked to speak to the manager he came out and it was apparent that he wanted to defend his host staff more than he wanted to fix the situation with the poor customer service. Needless to say we didn't stay, and we won't darken their doorstep ever again. We value ourselves, but obviously they didn't feel the same. When did it become okay to treat customers with such blatant displays of ignorance?\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Great place! The food is priced as it should be and the portions are generously applied.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Cool restaurant. Came for brunch while on a short trip to Pittsburgh. My BF loved their create your own Bloody Mary Bar. I ordered the chicken and waffles which was a huge plate of chicken, enough for feed at least 2 people. BF ordered the bibimbop which was a disappointment, he should have known not to order a Korean dish at a non-Korean resto! Recommend sticking to the more traditional menu items.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Arrived at 5 for a pre- show dinner, we're done and out by 6:30 with plenty of time for the 7 PM show. Dinner was a show unto itself! Our group sampled the Brussels sprouts appetizer- roasted with Parmesan cheese, and the pate, served with toasted bread in a cute little jar..very good with a sweet tang to it. I had the Mussels in a chili broth with sweet potato cubes and roasted chick peas...excellent and plentiful and a nice twist on Moules frites..I had mine with the spectacular Truffle fries with a mayo dip- that alone would suffice for a meal! My husband had the burger with pork belly and an egg...also amazing and huge. The Three little Piggy sandwich that was served could feed a family of four! I would definitely return to sample more of their fare. All was well done and huge portions. Would consider sharing next time.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Took my girl here for her 21st, wrote it on the online reservation. They gave us both free glasses of Champagne. The beer I ordered tapped out when my glass was 3/4ths of the way full, they let me have it for free.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was PGH restaurant week. Had strawberry watermelon gespatcho, pulled pork on cornbread, pork tacos with pickled cabbage and maple syrup, and a hot pecan desert. All courses were fantastic. \n",

      "I like the atmosphere, steampunk/industrial/country blend, with info graphics on cuts of beef. \n",

      "If your in the cultural district I'd check it out.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Made a reservation on this place, as last time it was a zoo without one! I would recommend a reservation before coming here, it's always busy. We came for Saturday brunch and had the Bloody Mary bar. Their Bloody Mary bar had a large selection of charcuterie, dolmas, cheeses and vodkas - even bacon and mini meat sticks. I got the steak frites. It was cooked perfectly, and the fries were really good! Not going to lie, my boyfriend got the chicken and waffles and those were even more tasty - everything you would want on a brunch! They gave him 4 huge pieces of chicken! The mimosas were good too. I would definitely come here again. 4 stars because even though the food was good and the service was great, it's not the best brunch I've ever had. This will definitely become a staple every time I visit Pittsburgh.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I've been here three times now and I am not sure what the hype is all about. It was pretty mediocre all the way around. The ribeye for two was the biggest disappointment of my life. No joke. After waiting almost an hour and half for it to come out, It was 90% gristle and fat. Yes I know Ribeyes are more fatty. Ribeyes are my preferred cut of meat. This was not up to snuff. Everything was very gimmicky and trendy just to be trendy. This restaurant is constantly hyped up by everything I read online and by everyone, but after this third visit I just cannot see the appeal.\n",

      "We made a point of checking out this \"HORRIBLE SITUATION.\" \n",
      "Do not be frightened. The bathrooms are part of the theater complex and in the SHARED lobby for the restaurant. They were spotlessly clean and obviously well maintained.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] If you are going to a show, this could not be more convenient.   Not to mention that the meals (fish, beaf, chicken, and duck) are awesome.   If you need reservations for a group or special occasion ask for Matthew who is unbelievably effective and accommodating.  Best restaurant in the cultural district. .. hands down.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Rachel C and I feasted like champion eaters at Meat & Potatoes. We started with the mussels, which were a very generous portion. They were served in a peppery curry sauce and we received some bread for dipping. Then the kitchen sent out some fried pickles and brussels on the house - both were great! \n",
      "\n",
      "Next up was the mac and cheese with chorizo and pulled pork (!!!). The cheese was definitely very Velveeta-esque (pretty sure it was Velveeta). Delish. I was so stuffed at this point that I really couldn't eat much of my main course. A shame because it was also awesome. Hanger steak with all kinds of veggies and potatoes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our server was great and very knowledgeable about the menu. When she brought over my slightly-dirty martini, she immediately asked me to let her know if it was too dirty. It was, and I appreciated that she recognized that right away. My replacement martini was just right. \n",

      "Next time I find myself in Pittsburgh, Meat and Potatoes is definitely on the agenda!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Outstanding food. My first visit I had a burger which was good but not excellent. Second time my wife and I ventured out into all different appetizers and tried the steak and fish entrees and they were excellent!! I would highly recommend the restaurant.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Tartare, sardines, gnocchi and pork chop along with craft cocktails and great service from KC... This place is great!  I will return and bring friends and family.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] The wagyu flat iron was indeed delicious. That alone can get 5 stars from me. the kobe corn dog was good but nothing outrageous. The fried taters were ok. You get a huge bowl if you order them...enough for two. Garlic all over them. Their selection is better at lunch vs. dinner it seems.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] We visited Meat & Potatoes last Saturday for a pre-dinner drink.  Upon arrival at 5:30pm, the restaurant AND bar were packed.  After making a circle around the bar to find seats, we went out to the hostess station to ask about a table.  Unfortunately, Meat & Potatoes was completely booked for the evening.  We really wanted to try at least something while we were there, so we went back to the bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sat down at the only empty seat while my fiancé stood next to me.    I asked the bartender (who looked amazing in the flannel shirt and cabby hat) for a drink suggestion.  Per my taste buds, he recommended the Vanilla Sky.  It tasted slightly tart with hints of anise and vanilla.  As a black licorice lover, I truly enjoyed this beverage!  My fiancé got the 21st Amendment Back in Black.  We both really enjoyed our drinks and plan on returning to Meat & Potatoes - on a night we have made reservations.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Hmmm...I love meat and potatoes, so when a friend asked me to go there for her birthday I agreed knowing it was super expensive and upscale.  It's also located downtown which equates to #parkingnightmare.  I'd say bus down there, but busing anywhere in Pittsburgh takes an eternity.  I digress.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food here is awful.  I got some kinda Bolognese Pasta, it tasted like dirty gym socks.  Not kidding.  The presentation was terrible, and it tasted warm as opposed to hot.  I'll do a warm hamburger from a fast food joint because they aren't charging $23, but not warm pasta from a place that has reservations and $50 and up plates.  They charge $5 or some shit for toast, so that's the kinda place this is.  The wine was delicious, but it's hard to mess up red wine for someone who imbibes as regularly as I do.  Had it not been for the wine, and company, I would probably 1 star it, but I'm no high class gal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was ok.  They kept trying to take all of my silverware and plates before I was done with my dishes.  It's like, back up, I'm not even finished eating yet.  And I used to serve tables for a long time, so I know the difference between hovering over a table, and allowing someone to eat and enjoy their company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the kicker, a friend got the highest priced plate cause he's a baller (unlike myself), and well, it's supposed to come with MASHED POTATOES.  Well, they said, \"we're out of mashed potatoes, would you like french fries?\"  My eyes got so big, as did his, and we were like \"are you for real?\".  Their like \"yes, we ran out (on a friday night no less), so if you want mashed potatoes, we will have to make more for you\".  He said, \"Ummm...if I'm ordering a $50 plate of steak and potatoes, I don't wanna eat french fries\".  Seriously.  I was floored.  They were kinda rude about  him wanting mashed potatoes, too.  And, as you can imagine, it took a very long time to get our food.\n",
      "\n",
      "The atmosphere in this place is cool, and our server was pretty efficient for the most part.  The birthday girl enjoyed her food (i think), but I wish we coulda just went to Thai Cuisine.  The steak looked greasy so I figured pasta\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] We loved it. The charcuterie board very good. The 34oz ribeye with fries  and bone marrow fabulous! Can't  wait to go back!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I love the food and drinks at meat and potatoes. I started going to this restaurant as soon as it opened and have been a loyal customer ever since. However, I must say the past 2 times I have been there I had the same waitress. I usually give wait staff a fair shot because I used to be a waitress, so I know it can be stressful. However, our waitress was not pleasant or friendly at all. She made us all uncomfortable with her non-friendly attitude. While the food was excellent the service needs to be improved a lot.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] The food was excellent!  My girlfriend and I stopped in for brunch prior to a Steelers game and were not disappointed!  I had the Chicken & Waffles, which were absolutely delicious.  I loved the spiciness in the skin of the fried chicken.  The Jalapeno Cheddar waffles balanced very nicely with the Bourbon, Bacon Syrup on top!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Restaurant came recommended by hotel staff.  First impression was positive.  Comfy seating for patrons while they wait for their table.  Staff was friendly, and the service was good.  The menu was eclectic.    I took the waiter's recommendation for appetizer, selecting the tartare.  This was a great choice!  Main course was wagyu flat iron.  Entree was prepared well with unique flavors (kolrabi and pickled veggies).  Didn't blow me away though.   Apps/Dinner/drinks for two was ~120 with tip.   Above average, but not sure it warrants a return trip for out-of-towners.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] We came here per an out of towners rec cross referenced with yelp. From the start it was a bad experience. We put our name and number down for our 40 minute wait. We asked if it was okay to walk down the block to check out the bridges. We get a call 10 minutes after we left telling us that it's going to be an additional 30 minutes as our table was just \"given away.\" We were literally down the street so we walked back to ask what the deal was, something about her forgetting to put us on the list (yet we were there when she did Plus it was right next to the phone number they called us on...) The three ladies up front suggest we might have better luck at another spot down the street. But we were determined to eat here. So we stand around. 10 minutes later we're seated. The hostess really needs to learn some time estimating skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "The meals: the French toast was good, not amazing. The candied bacon was a nice touch. The rancheros were nothing to write home about, pretty boring and not a lot of flavor. The chicken and waffles were about the same, there wasn't a whole lot of meat on the chicken so it was basically fried skin and waffles. I didn't try the pub burger as I'm not a red meat eater (I'm new to the meat eating game.) we ordered some bread to start as we were all pretty hungover from the wedding the night before, it took forever to come out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bellini was decent, apparently the Bloody Mary bar is \"amazing\" so if you're into a boozy brunch bar, there's that. The staff were pretty lax, had to ask a few times for coffee and water refills. The space it self is huge, but there was a live musician which cramped it up slightly. That being said, it was rather loud, we couldn't really hear the folks at our table chatting. The bathrooms are not even inside the space itself, but outside to the back in the lobby. Overall, I'd slip it, but I think I just have higher expectations from places with 4 stars\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I'm so thrilled to have such a charming true gastropub in the city, particularly in downtown where new restaurants seems to pop up then die out quickly. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had great expectations when first walking in - the ambiance had an upscale comfortable and quaint feel that made one fill right at home. The menu, which was an brown folder with age sheets of paper, had just the right amount of selections as to not overwhelm the guest with too many choices. I absolutely adored the cocktail list, and after 2 trips I have tried the Aviation (a twist on the \"traditional\" version which I believe does not call for grapefruit juice), the Sazerac, and the Old Canadian. The Old Canadian proved to be my favorite, meringue in a cocktail is simply one of the greatest ideas a cocktailian has ever had...go early 1900's. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm fairly certain that ever dish was concocted by the devil, everything was perfect! The mussels were fresh, plump, and they didn't have the fishy taste that is all too common in restaurants, and yes, believe it or not mussels really shouldn't taste like that. Next came the duck liver pate, served in a small clasped, jar with a couple slices of toasty, buttery baguette. Unfortunately not enough bread for the large amount of pate. Either way, the smooth, savory taste of duck pate on crunch bread is one I'll never forget. The pork belly potato skins were probably one of the best things I've ever had, though I can't it was particularly good for my health. You have to splurge some times? Snail and blue cheese risotto had great potential, though it was not as creamy as a risotto should be - it was a little on the watery side. I had no idea apple played a role in the dish, quite a minor role to say the least.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is the type of place you want to spend some time in, which is exactly what I'm looking for in a restaurant. I could sit in the dangerously comfortable chairs, or the well designed, open bar for hours drinking prohibition cocktails and munching on the small bites. Seriously, you need to go.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Came here for lunch. Seats weren't that hard to get if you come between 12:00-12:30pm. Any later then the place would get packed. Wish I came here for dinner so I can try their bone marrow. Let me skip to the chase and let you know what to order and what not to order.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Roasted Brussels Sprouts: get it! Perfectly roasted, not bitter and covered with cheese\n",
      "- Fried Pickles: get this but keep in mind it's piping hot so don't burn your tongue like I did\n",
      "- Grilled Pork Chop: perfectly cooked- usually I'm skeptical of ordering pork chops because once you cook it too long, there's no saving it- you'll be stuck with dry tasteless pork...however! Meat & Potatoes does it just right. Paired with veggies and pork belly with a hint of Asian flavors, this is the dish to get\n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely will be back when I'm around. I need to try their dinner menu!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] The food was tasty.  The lighting was a bit dark for my taste, but the food made up for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered the \"meat and potatoes\" dish for 2...and it should have come with a disclaimer.  A Flintstones sized steak came out that covered most of the table, accompanied by like 4 steak fries.  Next time I'll go with 4 people, order one of these and a few sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Yum,\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] We go into Meat and Potatoes to get a table. We did not have a reservation and they said it would be about an hour wait. So we opted to sit at the bar where there were two seats available and they serve a full menu there. Jan ordered the brussel sprout appetizer .  It was absolutely delicious . I ordered the duck breast Jan ordered the black bass. The duck was well prepared and seasoned correctly. The sea bass on the other hand was overcooked and so salty Jan could hardly eat it. We will not be ordering the black bass at  Meat and Potatoes again.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Second time we've been here and it doesn't disappoint.  Had a reservation for 6:45, but they were great and seated us early.  Buttermilk chicken livers, Devil's Backbone for appetizers, Sgt. Pepper's Old Fashioned, great entrees and outstanding service from Kate!  Looking forward to next visit!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I went to Meat and Potatoes for a friends birthday dinner. We made reservations far in advance, so that was not an issue. However, it is connected to one of the theaters so it is frequently packed with the show crowd. \n",
      "\n",
      "The ambience of the restauarant is really nice, it is a bit dark and small inside but is very cozy. I thought it would be a really good date place. It also has outside seating, but it was cold when we went so we did not have a chance to check that out. \n",
      "\n",
      "As my drink, I got the bourbon smash which has bourbon crushed with mint leaves and berries and oh my god is it delicious. I have tried numerous times to create it myself at home with some bulleit bourbon, mint, berries and simple syrup but I have never been able to recreate it perfectly. \n",
      "\n",
      "We got the bone marrow as an appetizer. I thought the presentation was really nice, the bone itself came out and had small dishes with sea salt, capers, and some other type of spice. It was presented with delicious toasty bread. While I was not a huge fan of the bone marrow itself, it went on the bread like butter and what really made it stand out was the garnishes to put on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "For my entree I got the duck. It was presented in slices, and almost looked like steak. I ordered it medium rare and it was really delicious. My friend had the turducken special, and while I could not stop giggling at the concept/name, it was a really good special too.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Nice atmosphere, food is decent. I found the serving sizes varied a lot from dish to dish. Drinks are delicious.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Cool hip ambiance comfortable seating  nice lighting  and great cocktails especially the old time refresher.  Started with the devils on horseback which were delicious.  Then continued with the flat iron steak and braised Brussels which were both ridiculously great! Highly recommend. Mike the bartender was very accomadating!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] We made a late night reservation because they are supposed to have the best burger in Pennsylvania. We almost walked out because the service was very slow. Once our waiter remembered us everything was great. The pub burger was excellent, a great poutine as well. Nice wine selection. Our waiter was great, I'm sure he was in the weeds. It was packed, even late at night. Reservations recommended.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Overall is good but nothing special. We ordered mussel, bone marrow, Brussels, lamb neck, burgher, pasta and a kind of fish. The lamb neck and the sauce of the fish is good. It's a good place if you like new American food. You won't regret but you also won't get something out of expect, something make you say amazing. \n",
      "And the dessert toffee cake is good!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Meat & Potatoes has really yummy food.  My husband and I tried the specialty mushroom risotto, bone marrow flat bread, mushroom flatbread and the salmon.  They were all delicious.  This restaurant reminds of me a similar restaurant in Los Angeles that Iron Chef Mario Batali owns, called Mozza.  I must say, the server kept making mistakes with our food and brought out things that we didn't order, but that wasn't a big deal.  We loved this place and can't wait to go back.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] *****Excellent restaurant***** Make reservations. It's so much more sophisticated than its name might suggest. Certainly a top notch place for any gourmand. The bone marrow and duck are absolutely fantastic.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Not sure we could have had a better dining experience anywhere. We were seated promptly at the time of our reservation and found the decor to be very welcoming and the chairs very comfortable. We started with a drink and ordered some wine, then ordered a couple of appetizers. My wife's \"Kobe corn dog\" made her day and the curry mussels were the best thing I have eaten in a long time. The portion was huge and I would have gladly eaten the curry broth as a soup!  We got the meat and potatoes for two, which was cooked absolutely perfectly and we ate almost all of the gigantic portion. Although slightly under salted, it was a great presentation and a very nice cut of ribeye. Our dessert, some type of chocolate pot de creme, was delicious as well. The service was fantastic and I felt that, although expensive, the meal was a good value. Can't wait for our next trip!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I really love the food here. I've been here a couple of times. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. They have the best fried pickles I've ever had and I used to live in the south. \n",
      "I give it 4 stars because whoever is running the front desk/telephones is pretty rude. We made a reservation and they told my husband we could have it but we had to be out by 7:15. Okay...great. Then they called to confirm our reservation and told us the same thing. I think that's pretty rude and strange to say to a paying costumer.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] As soon as I knew I was traveling to Pittsburgh for work, I searched on my Yelp app restaurants and things to do near my hotel.  One of the places I bookmarked was Meat & Potatoes.  Talking to one of my Yelp friends, the night before I left on my trip, he recommended this same place so, now, of course, I must go.\n",
      "\n",
      "I arrived in Pittsburgh on a Wednesday.  That night, I went straight to this restaurant.  I could see it was busy but, I only needed a table for one so I thought I would be able to get in.  Nope, it was 100% full and wait time was about 1.5 hours.  Good sign...  week day and this busy, must be really good.  So, again, using my Yelp app I made a reservation for Lunch the next day (should have done this from the very beginning...)  \n",
      "\n",
      "They opened at 11:30am, and my reservation was at 12:15pm.  I arrived right on time and was happy to see it wasn't crowded this time so, plenty of seats to choose from.  I sat right in front of the bar, where I could see the mixologist working her magic.\n",
      "\n",
      "My server was great, friendly, always with a smile, and gave excellent recommendations.  I was between a pasta dish and the mussels.  Since it was lunch time, she said the pasta would be too heavy and I would definitely have leftovers (not practical when staying at a hotel) so I went with the mussels which I love, and can say they have one of the best dishes I've ever had.  It's an almost endless mountain of mussels in a coconut milk, lemongrass, curry broth, with cilantro and chili.  The chili is spread out through the mussels so you get the heat from it on some and it's absolutely delicious.  On top of that it comes with half a loaf of perfectly made garlic bread.  I'm not a fan of garlic but this, I could not resist, it is divine by itself and even better when dunked in the broth.  This dish is truly outstanding...  you can see for yourself, check out the picture I took and tell me your mouth is not watering immediately...\n",
      "\n",
      "Other thing I love is trying signature drinks, especially when you see a bar like the one at Meat & Potatoes.  Equipped with every tool necessary for a mixologist (not a bartender), glasses of every type, herbs, bitters, fruits, you name it, they have it.  After looking through the \"Libations\" menu I went with the Vieux Carre - hennesy cognac / bulleit rye / cocchi vermouth di torino / benedictine / angosutra & peychaud.  My server described this as an \"in between a Manhattan and an Old Fashioned\".  They add one of those big blocks of ice to keep the drink cold and not watered down, and a lemon rind.  It's elegant, strong, but smooth and with a touch of sweetness, excellent for sipping and enjoy the beautiful bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "They also have outside seating, which I'm sure would be very enjoyable on a beautiful day or night but, personally, after seeing the décor and bar inside, if I ever have the chance to go back, that's where I would like to be.  Where I can see those wonderful drinks be created and the amazing food is just steps away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of what time you go, where you sit, or what you order, I assure you, one visit is all it takes to become a fan of this place.  To those living in the area...  lucky you!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] All the hype around this place, it's all true. Both the experience and the food are in line with each other and it's all worth the trouble of finding an open table here. Definitely reserve a table in advance. When my husband and I went, we were lucky to find an open table as walk-ins, possibly because it was a weeknight. We ordered the Devils on horseback, Thai curry mussels (with fries) and the pork belly tacos. Omg the flavors here are so incredibly bold, but not overpowering in any way. The reason for my reduction of one star you ask? I got sick afterwards. I can't exactly pinpoint this meal as the culprit, but I'm almost certain the mussels were it. Despite getting a little sick, I would definitely come back to try something different next time. The food here is just that worth it.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Nice atmosphere...requested and received table outside based on reviews seen here. Our server was attentive and food was prepared promptly. We had the fried Brussel sprouts which I liked but my dinner companion felt were way too salty and fried to the point of verging on burnt.  The Pimento Mac N cheese was good but not outstanding.  We also shared an order of mussels cooked in a tomato cream basil sauce.  The order was plentiful and the sauce was very good, but the quality of the mussels was inconsistent...some being quite small.  I really wanted to like this restaurant but I felt like for the quality of the food, the prices weren't justified.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I went to Brunch at Meat and Potatoes on Saturday morning with my girlfriend and loved it! The service was great, the food was delicious and overall we both had a great experience. One helpful hint before going to M&P would be to try and do a reservation, just to make sure you can get a table as it seemed like a hot spot for Brunch (and have heard it gets packed in general). Here is a my full breakdown of M&P:\n",
      "\n",
      "Service (5 out of 5): As states, the service was great! The server was very nice and really helpful as this was our first time at M&P. She was an excellent server overall (I was a server at one point and know how hard it can be sometimes). \n",

      "Décor (5 out of 5): I really enjoyed the décor of M&P and loved the overall atmosphere of the place. Although it was a bit warm for me when I went, I really like that they have an outdoor patio for those who wish to eat outside. \n",
      "\n",
      "Food (5 out of 5): For brunch, I had the salmon flat bread and my girlfriend had their French Toast. I found the Salmon flat bread to be the perfect amount of food and to be very flavorful! I had some of my girlfriend's French toast and it was certainly a treat! The French toast was cooked perfectly and was the perfect amount of sweet. I would vote for the Salmon flat bread over the French Toast only b/c the French Toast is a lot of food and can be very filling (still worth it to try it though if you are starving or want to split something). \n",
      "\n",
      "On a side note, M&P also had a Bloody Mary bar. Neither of us had a Bloody Mary, but were sitting next to it. Everything that was being made looked good, if you are into Bloody Mary's.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Love this place! We usually end up here before or after theatre. Great cocktails and food. If you have not been here, it is a must. There is not a bad choice on the menu.\n",

      "Very cool decor, interesting menu, pretty good beer selection (I had an IPA from 21st Amendment brewery) but the reason this is five stars is the service. I sat at the bar and the three guys behind there were awesome.  Made great recommendations, made sure I had everything I needed and provided by far the best service I've ever had in Pittsburgh.\n",
      "\n",
      "They get bonus points because one guy noticed I was wearing an Archer t-shirt and asked if I knew the Bloody Mary prayer**, which of course I did.  He said a lot of the bartenders have been reciting that.  Nice.\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Went here last night with a coworker on a business trip and we were both blown away.  Loved the well thought out food, the atmosphere, and the service. Good beer selection for me and my friend liked her wine. We had a delicious mushroom risotto for appetizer. The portion was more than enough and we left some in the bowl only because we didn't want to fill up too much.  I had the lamb burger-medium, as recommended by the chef. The generous serving of hand cut, shoestring fries were crispy and cooked until they were dark golden brown and served with a side of spicy ketchup, which was also fun. Our server was very knowledgable about the menu. Fun atmosphere too. Although I'm not in Pittsburgh often and I hope to make it back here sometime.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] This restaurant is well suited for dating and the food here is good. The bartender was very friendly when I and my girlfriend visited. We ordered duck breast and it was well cooked.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Went to dinner before a show. I've been there a good number of times since their opening, but it's been about a year since my last visit. I was pleased that it still stood up to my previous visits. We order the squid ink tagliatelle pasta dish, and it was honestly spectacular. Their Brussels and grilled bread were good starters and they salty pig flat bread was as good as always. The only negative was that we ordered two more beers towards the end of our meal as waters, and we never got them, even after we asked twice.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Been there twice while visiting the city. Both times were magnificent! First, the space is very fancy urban farm to table atmosphere with many interesting concoctions to drink as well as a great beer list. Devils on horseback- delicious, sweet and savory bites of heaven...bone marrow-I think about this plate and my mouth waters! With the perfect little complementing additions to enhance the rich fatty beef flavor, it is like there isn't enough. I swear this would be my choice of a \"last meal\". Steak for two is what we ate both times because it was so impressive from other yelp reviews as well as in person the first round...you can't go wrong! A great date spot and atmosphere to get a little fancy but- warning that you sit VERY close to other people so not an intimate atmosphere but a great pregame place to get a full belly and do a little downtown exploring.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Trendy ad f**k lol. This place reminded me more of a philly spot than an NY...can't put my finger on it but that's just the vibe I got. My bartender made me some really sexy drinks while looking great with a super cool hair cut and outfit complete with vest. The bar staff knew their stuff I will say. I really felt like I benefited meal wise by sitting at the bar and not a table. I got to ask random questions about anything on the menu. I went with the steak tartare which was great but it had a lot going on. Brisket Mac n cheese was amazing and so filling. Just an app but it hit me like a brick. Great drinks, great food and a really sexy atmosphere. Parking was relatively easy too one street over (free after 6). Great place for a date or drink after work.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I like this place a lot.  I think reservations are a good idea when heading here in the evening, probably mandatory if you're going on a weekend.  Good food, good service, wheelchair accessible including the bathrooms, although the dining room is more than a little tight!  I definitely recommend reservations if you're in a chair like my husband, although we have had good success just showing up, even if it is a little uncomfortable for the people that need to squeeze by his chair.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] This place is hip and has some great offerings. I've been here a number of times and have to say the pub burger and three little pigs sandwich are my favs - not very health conscious but delicious. \n",
      "Cocktails are a feature - love the vanilla sky. I tried an absinthe based drink once and though well crafted, it was a bit too sweet for my taste. \n",
      "Don't expect to drink beer from a bottle here. Anything not in draft form uniquely comes in a can!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Amazing spot!  Staff was prepared for our reservation, atmosphere was a buzz, food was spectacular. Bone marrow, mussels, and salmon main were all raved about.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] While Meat & Potatoes is certainly one of the trendier places in downtown Pittsburgh, and does have good food, I would leave the food at that- good.  While you will certainly enjoy your meal, for the price the food is, I would need to go again for a special occasion or reason. My favorite part was probably the interior/atmosphere over the quality of food.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Not being a big fan of meat or their very popular \"meat butter\" aka bone marrow, I do hear this is AMAZING!  I personally enjoy the mushroom flatbread and have gone to the Sunday brunch on several occasions.  I do think this restaurant has one of the best, if not the best atmosphere in the city.  The lighting is great, sets a very cozy tone and I also like that overflow can sit in the cozy little sitting area in the lobby (and order food and drinks).  Cecil is a fantastic bartender and really enjoys the craft of making cocktails.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Meat and potatoes, it's a neat little spot with great ambience. For the price, I think it's a little over price for the food. It was great food but it's like any other burger joint I've been to. I got the skirt steak taco, it was very chewy. I was expecting to be able to bit into my taco and have an ease to chew instead of cutting it. My fiancé got the burger, it was tasty. Service was great, she gave us her opinion of her favorite dishes. Fries were great. I want to give this place a 3.5 stars, but 4 will have to do.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Worst service ever and the bar service sets a new low for customer satisfaction. Wouldn't recommend this to any person\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] This place is aaaaamazing.  We didn't have reservations, and on a busy theatre night, we were seated at the bar.  Unknowingly, we chose to check out the place on a night where happy hour involved half priced cocktails (think depression era libations) and $3 tin beer.  It was my first go at a San Franciscan black IPA, which was recommended to us by the bartender.  Beer fans, if you haven't already tried the \"Back in Black,\" run to Meat and Potatoes right now.  We started with the beef tartar and bone marrow, then moved onto the salmon with brussel sprout kimchi and pork chop.  Everything was delicious (especially the brussel sprout kimchi!).  The pork chop was perfectly cooked, topped with bacon, and is still making my mouth water...The menu items are incredibly innovative and prepared perfectly.  I'll definitely be coming back soon!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] As a lifetime card-carrying carnivore, this joint is in my top five for meatastic vittles.  High-end butcher block slaughterhouse meets dragon flame, then served up big, blocky and fancy.  Put it this way:  it's the only place I've even been to that serves bone marrow as \"butter\" for your bread.  Yes.  See me nodding?  Yeah, you do!  Om-nom-nom!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Bring your loot, bring your sharp-toothed T-rex date and expect to pick good stuff out of your teeth for hours after.  (*urp!*)  Yeah... it's like that.  #paleobeforeitwascool\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Stopped here for a drink after a downtown event.  Drinks were very imaginative and delicious.  One in our party tried the most amazing looking grilled cheese.  Corn dog may be the best I have ever tried.  The mussels were good but nothing outstanding.  Server and decor were very casual and inviting.  Would definitely return.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] My boyfriend took me here for my birthday-last Tuesday. He made a reservation, told them it was my birthday and asked if they did anything special for birthday, the gentleman said 'yes of course we do'. Got there ten minutes early, the hostess did not even mention anything about it being my birthday, and sat us immediately (into a sardine can). The people on each side were about two feet from us.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Food: We got a 'snack' - the toast with goat butter and jam- very tasty and reasonable priced. Then we ordered the \"meat and potatoes for two\". The steak fries, bone marrow, and mushrooms were really good, but the steak was 70% fat, it was $50 for the steak. For $50 it should have been a lean cut of meat. We cut close 50% of it off because of all the fat. *All of the food took a while to come out but that is to be expected when you are paying a lot for a meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "We asked for a box and the check and our waitress came back with a box, then she final recognized that it was my birthday by saying 'oh you aren't interested in a birthday dessert?' We declined. She did not even wish me a happy birthday or even wish me a wonderful night, just okay I'll get your check. \n",
      "\n",
      "They have a lot of interesting foods on the menu so I might go back again. But I would never go back if celebrating a special event. Terrible ambiance, too noisy, it's not romantic, did nothing to make me feel 'special' on my birthday. (I'd recommend Morton's on Liberty for that).\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] We visited Meat and Potatoes while in Pittsburg, this place was awesome!!! Drinks were great, service was awesome and food was delish!\n",
      "  This restaurant has a really cool vibe, it is casual dress but still feels fancy. My husband always eats here when is is town for business and I was thrilled he brought me!\n",
      "  This is a must try when in the burg!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Just moved back to Pittsburgh after 8 years, and this was our first big \"must go\", and it was totally worthy!\n",
      "\n",
      "Great ambiance, great service, and really great food. We had a friend in town from Chicago, and she loved it as well. The devils on horseback were my favorite item, but the bone marrow was excellent (huge portion!), as was the short rib flat bread. The drinks were pricey, but that's the norm for specialty cocktails these days. They were well made and worth it as well. The Bramble and Glenshaw Sour really stood out. \n",
      "\n",
      "Can't wait to add this to our list of \"regulars!\"\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I have been here twice and my first experience was the best! Typically, you should make a reservation before coming here because it gets filled up pretty quickly. I love coming to this restaurant because they provide a good dining experience. The service is great and the ambiance of the restaurant is wonderful as well. It has a hipster, rustic, and natural feel to it. The low lighting adds to it as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was excited to order the bone marrow because we have never had it before. I have always been hesitant to try it but I am glad I ordered it from Meat & Potatoes. These huge pieces of bone marrow come out piping hot and it is served with grilled bread. It is paired with 3 toppings which consists of picked onions, capers, and sea salt. You spread the bone marrow on the bread and place your desired toppings on it and voila, a creamy and divine appetizer is ready! The initial bite will make your taste buds happy, happy, happy! It is so creamy and buttery! The pickled onions provide a nice crunch and tangy flavor to the buttery taste of the bone marrow. I highly recommend ordering this if you are up to being adventurous! \n",
      "\n",
      "We also ordered the Short Rib Papperdelle, flatbread pizza, and Truffle Mac and Cheese. My favorite thing was by far the Short Rib Papperdelle. The creamy tomato sauce is perfect and the short rib was melt in your mouth. The papperdelle soaks up all of the sauce and tastes incredible! You could probably pass on the flatbread pizza because it wasn't that fantastic. I think they serve the truffle mac and cheese once in awhile because we did not see it on our second visit there. The truffle mac and cheese was phenomenal! It was cheesy and the flavor was heightened by the incredibly taste of truffles! \n",
      "\n",
      "There are also plenty of cocktails that you can select from on their menu. The bar is gorgeous and you could also dine there as well. I would highly recommend coming here if you are in the downtown area of Pittsburgh!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] If you want IMPECCABLE service, GREAT wait staff, and AMAZING food....DON'T COME HERE. \n",
      "Where do I begin to even comprehend to you the ATROCIOUS customer service this place has....not only were the people SARCASTIC but they have no idea what the proper etiquette is for greeting and welcoming people. YOU SAY HELLO NOT WAIT FOR US TO SAY HI CAN I HAVE A TABLE....OBVIOUSLY we were here to eat and not just stare at you while we WAIT for you to notice us...even though we WERE THE ONLY people in front of you. We had a friend waiting for us and he had stated that he was outside, well I informed the hostess since I didnt want to be rude and just walk in, that we were here to sit outside since a friend already had a table for us. Well, she pointed at the door and stated \" its that way\", then turned back to whatever she was doing....ok.....so we head out sit ourselves down. \n",
      "\n",
      "With a name like Meat and Potatoes you would think MEAT and Potatoes would be the highlight...but nothing really AMAZING caught my eye in regards to that. I ordered steak BLUE along with some type of potato ( mashed) The plate LOOKED pretty but lacked flavor only salt. The apparent \"bed of brussel sprouts\" was just (I am guess 2 AT MOST). The waitress was no where to be seen, we even had to waive down another server for refills on drinks. Only other time she actually came was to give us the check....Note to servers, if you have people seated outside, check on them. When we wanted to pay, we waited an additional fifteen minutes until we GAVE UP and walked inside to pay....ONLY TO BE TOLD TO SIT DOWN AND OUR WAITRESS WAS GOING TO ASSIST US....Well GEE, if she showed up more than TWICE in our whole evening then maybe... JUST maybe we would have, but that was not the case.   \n",
      "I then went inside to buy some shirts and when I informed the woman at the front that I wanted to buy shirts she snickered at me and said,\" I have to go get the manager because I dont have the key for that\" Ok, no problem....got my shirts and left....\n",
      "\n",
      "I have had bad service, but honestly this place gives Pittsburgh a bad reputation, this is not a restaurant you would want to visit if you are looking for quality food, great service and a memorable experience.  Go ANYWHERE but here.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I know you can't go wrong with fried chicken but this chicken was different. Absolutely amazing.  My husband had the chicken paillard and it was amazing too!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Man was I glad I was able to score the one remaining seat at the bar for dinner. If you'll excuse the NY-centric description, M&P represents the middle ground between Brooklyn and Midtown. It's spacious and people stop there before the game, but it has chalk menus and interesting light fixtures and fresh craft cocktails. I can't recommend reservations enough, especially if there's anything going on across the river.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck & looks like a duck, then it's duck so please send it to Meat and Potatoes promptly as I will be over to eat it shortly.  Just thinking about it gets me all quacked up.  First time there but definitely not our last trip to M&P.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We arranged reservations almost 2 weeks in advance and when we arrived the waiting area was packed with other reservation holders so reservations are a must.  I did see a table or two that was not occupied during our early dinner but I chuck that up to the hours we were dining, 5pm on a Saturday.  Well it worked out perfect since we were coming from an afternoon show.\n",
      "\n",
      "I studied the menu for two weeks looking it over and over and wondering what I would order.  I had thought of the fried pickles as these are one of my favorites, or the pork belly taco's because come on pork belly in a taco!  Yum, but no.  My recent love affair with duck had me swooning for it...  I also saw so many wonderful pictures of the bone marrow I had to give that a shot too.  I can say confidently that I picked wisely.  This was one of the best meals I have had in a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I looked to my H who I convinced to order the Wagyu, I stated, \"Welcome to my new favorite restaurant\".  He absolutely loved the wagya, he said I wish there was just one more piece of it.  I think he could have had two... Lucky for me my plate filled me and though I could have eaten more I didn't have to, the portion was perfect.  I could've done without the pierogies.   I love pierogies but this one wasn't my thing.  All is fine I gladly gave them to my H to eat and he happily did so.  The atmosphere here seems casual with an upscale feel at the same time and the seats were like sitting on your overstuffed couch.  I melted in.  I will be back M&P you really got all your ducks in a row.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Awesome food, amazing place. We've been there 3 or 4 times and can't wait to go back. Have not been disappointed! The pate will blow your mind! Bone marrow is always a must, also.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Lot of good things to say about M&P and a few less good too - so I'll do a pro and con, for a chance. But overall a very very good place downtown!\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros: the restaurant is very nice, with a great oval bar at the center, and tables around. Very high ceiling, great rusty colors, a bit shadowy. I like it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cocktails! I tried a few that night, and I liked all of them (some more than others). In fact, these may be the best cocktails i have had in Pittsburgh so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food! The bone marrows are as impressive as the other reviews say. Huge. No HUGE, and tasty. Not for the faint of hear though: that's not light on your belly. The duck was fantastic and so was the flat iron. The tartare was good, although I have had better in Pittsburgh (Salt's is often better for instance). \n",
      "\n",
      "The portions are fit for Pittsburgh. Enormous. too much actually (do we need to have 3 enormous bones for the bone marrow?), but I suppose some would grumble on yelp if they were a tiny bit smaller. Yinzers have a big stomach. \n",
      "\n",
      "The menu is not very large, and is fairly conservative (steaks, duck, salmon) with a few sandwiches. But it all seems very good. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cons: the tables are really close to each other if you are dining in the section with tables for 2. You may hear your neighbors, and this may be less than exciting. At 8:30 a Tuesday, we did not have the problem. The tables emptied soon after we arrived. Good strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wine we tried (a malbec from argentina) was less than impressive. We did not finish it. Worth a star off? nope. The pros make up for it. \n",
      "\n",
      "The coffee was god awful - what's wrong M&P? And there is no espresso. Really? Like in 2014, in a fancy restaurant? \n",
      "\n",
      "Oh yeah and it's hard to get a table over the week end. Booking is required. The bar is also quite full over the week end. \n",
      "\n",
      "We'll be back for sure.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] This is one of my favorite spots. The only reason I didn't go for the full 5 stars is that even with a reservation - you might still wait. The ambiance is great. Low key vibe and awesome decor. The food is amazing. I almost always go for the mussels, which can't be beat. But we've also shared a lot of the apps and been impressed. Backroom is great for larger groups or work related entertaining as well. Fun place to go but be sure to make a reservation well in advance!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I've been here multiple times. The first was for a bachelor/ette party. We booked the party room in the back and had excellent service. The menu was limited because we were a private party, but everyone found something they liked. The reason I LOVE this restaurant though is brunch. Sunday brunch is about as good as it gets in my world, and M&P's is the best. The Bloody Mary bar is phenomenal with every possible addition you can think of from standard veggies, to mozz cheese, to horseradish. They also infuse the vodka's themselves. Go to brunch!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I have been to Meat and Potatoes several times but had not been there for about a year. I am sad to say that I think this place has \"jumped the shark\". Same menu from two years back generally and the place now just seems a bit tired. All of those cutting edge dishes are now just me-too's. Nothing special. Service was lackadaisical. No need to rush back here.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] All I can say is FABULOUS!\n",

It is elegant and very normally priced, and the food is just unreal. I definitely will return again soon! Also, reservations are necessary. Don't try to go on a Friday or Saturday (or any night really) without a reservation, because chances are they are completely booked!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] This is a place perfect for only drinks at the bar and some appetizers . Loved the atmosphere and the interior.  It's so over rated though,sorry to say. I was there yesterday and I had some steak,brussels n fries! Omg so saltyyy and the steak was cold and I could smell the cow! It was gross I couldn't eat it! Don't go there to eat!\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] After having a disappointing experience at the restaurant, Tolga, the owner, got in touch with me, listened to my issues, and shared his philosophy of owning up to mistakes and the importance of conveying that to the customer with honesty.  He will be addressing our concerns directly with the staff. This is a man who is passionate about his business and has the right attitude (and extraordinary culinary talent) to make it successful.  We will be giving Meat and Potatoes another try.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Expected a typical steak place, in fact, just one steak item on the menu. Started with a fantastic punch from the bowl right on the bar, drinks are unique & very good selection of microbrews. Fried Brussel sprouts were excellent as was mushroom risotto. Hubby's steak was good but lukewarm. Lose a star for hipper-than-thou staff - which I think is the concept but unfortunately came with the  attitude to match. Tables were tiny & jammed up against each other. We gave up our table, moved to the bar, and had a very good experience.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Had Sunday brunch here and everything we had was delicious. Short rib hash, French toast, and the chicken and waffles. I enjoied the music , the only probelm we had was the the table was super small. It seemed cramped when eating.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] So I'm a little in love with this place right now.  And damn, I forgot to steal a cool \"cuts of cow\" coaster again!\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been here twice now, both times to the bar area.  Thursday night was packed, room in the dining area for reservations only.  So I wandered to the bar and found a seat.  The bartenders...these guys are the best.  Cecil (I think)...is the man.  Their cocktail list is short, but these guys know their stuff.  I opted for the Pimm's Blue Ribbon - which combines my two favorites, St. Germain and PBR.  This is a dangerously drinkable drink...I know, I had several.  The gentleman next to me had a Sazerac, which I hadn't experienced before.  This is where Cecil stepped in and gave us a vibrant and detailed history of the drink - which was awesome.  The Sazerac isn't on the cocktail list, but again these guys know their stuff, and I would recommend giving it a shot if you enjoy Rye.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, for food.  Well by this point I've noshed on the Brussel sprouts, and exquisite Ceasar salad, the Lobster Mac n Cheese and the Banana Pie.  Brussel spouts are very good, but the dipping sauce they come with is even better.  Not potent, but buttery and smooth.  The Cesear salad is creamy, and topped with real, homemade pork rinds.  Now, these have never appealed to me before - but the crunchy texture and saltiness in contrast to the salad (topped with an egg...yes) was spot on.  Lobster mac is as pure as it can be.  I stopped in last night for dessert and tried the banana pie.  What came out was a little jar of heaven.  It was a banana bread type deal, layered with whipped cream and caramel...and there was a hint of peanut butter.  It was good.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the bartenders and solid food, I would definitely recommend this place.  The atmosphere is upscale but casual and in a great locale.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] You would love this place!! Ordered fried Brussels for an app then mussels (curry, lemongrass, chili, lime, coconut milk and cilantro) with frites and black truffle mayo\n",
      "\n",
      "App was $5 and mussels were $16... Really not too bad\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] We had no less than two people telling us this was the best restaurant in Pittsburgh, so it's a good thing it's on our way back to the hotel from the office. We stopped by at about 6pm on a Monday and was told the only tables they had were outside. We were totally OK with that, since Pittsburgh was a lot nicer than DC and the outside tables had cover over them. \n",
      "\n",
      "We decided to get the bone marrow dish after reading so many yelp reviews, really having no idea what to expect. I've had bone marrow at home before, usually when my parents cook down huge bones for the soup base, but never at a restaurant. It's one of those things where I thought Americans don't usually eat. Anyway, the bone marrow came out with three huge bones where you can scoop out the marrow. It also came with four little toppings, pickled onion, capers, some kind of lime/cilantro mix, and another I can't remember. You use it as a spread on the toasted pieces of bread with the toppings. It was interesting. I'd say try it if you haven't, but I wouldn't order it again. It's quite heavy and fatty and oily, so you can't really eat that much, but definitely worth a try. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the lobster mac and cheese because I was planning on ordering the mussels and the waiter said the mussels had a pretty big portion, but I may still need something small on the side. Now the mac and cheese was heavenly! With a lot of lobster chunks in it! It's pretty much half lobster and half mac. So totally worth it. Then there was the mussels with the curry sauce. I can't resist mussels at a restaurant, especially when it's a curry sauce. I loved it! And it was a huge portion, even with all the shells! My coworker ordered the duck dish and it looked super good though. He really enjoyed it. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm so glad we got to try this place. I am kind of curious what the inside looks like. Maybe we'll get a chance to go back.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Personally，Rosted chicken doesnt taste better than the 5 dollar roasted chicken I bought from Kroger，just personally.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I just went to Meat and Potatoes this weekend with a group of people. We made the reservations over a month in advance because it is such a small restaurant that it was hard to get in with a group of 10. Between all of us we tried a variety of different things on the menu. Appetizers- the Devils on Horseback were surprisingly good. I didn't think I would like them, but they were probably the best app we had. They has a fried Mac and cheese appetizer special which several people tried and it was nothing to write home about. The corn dog was pretty good, but had some kick to it! For entrees - I got the pot roast, which was pretty good by pot roast standards. The hanger steak was too small of a portion for the meat lover in our group but they said it was great. The pork chop was GIANT and really juicy, but the slaw side that came with it was too spicy for me. And the duck was excellent. Our service was pretty good and the drinks were delicious, but pricey. All in all an exceptional meal, and will go back, but maybe not worth the month and a half of anticipation!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I can't review the food here but am disappointed in the service I received because I made reservations for 7 people a week in advance for a Thursday night dinner. We showed up to the restaurant with 1 more person and they told us they couldn't accommodate our party until at least 1030 when it was only 730. We told them we would squeeze the other person in and didn't mind if it was tight but they told us no and to try Six Penn down the street. Not very good customer service in my opinion, so 2 stars.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] If you're fortunate enough  to not be seated in the cramped 2 top steerage class, and to have a server that cares enough to tell you about the 'specials board', then it's great. Off-times are best if one wants to indulge in the brunch bloody bar.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] The food is always top notch, the bar man is charming at attentive, and service is usually pretty smooth. My only critique would be that the restaurant seating is a little awkward. Every time I go in I opt to sit at the bar so I don't get crammed in side-by-side with another table. Also, if you haven't tried absinthe, do it! It takes a few minutes to prepare, but it's delicious. Definitely worth a try.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I've been here many times now, and I'm never let down.  The service is always great, love their beer selection, and the BF has vouched for their cocktails.  I've been trying endlessly to replicate their white truffle risotto - it's to die for!  I definitely prefer their dinner menu to their lunch menu, but I have never been disappointed here.  I came here with my family from Chicago recently, and they seemed to really enjoy it as well.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Really enjoyable dinner. Flank steak was wonderful. Ceviche and duck were delicious too.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Amazing quality food, absolutely delicious. I only wish they changed their menu up more often, I feel like I always end up getting the same thing because nothing new pops out at me. That being said, I can't complain about the steak because it's extraordinary.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Now that you have to book a spot at M&P brunch three weeks in advance, the anticipation of the visit feels like half the fun. The meal itself isn't bad, either. ;)\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bloody Mary bar is the highlight of the trip, every time, all the time. Grape leaves, sun-dried tomatoes, whole roasted garlic, sweet peppers, and every hot sauce on earth are just some of the accouterments to choose from when you take the plunge of building your own brunch time beverage experience. Don't be if it takes you six or seven minutes to craft your savory beverage/breakfast snack cup.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now armed with two cups of booze and snacks, we return to our inappropriately small, round table to receive our meals from a despondent server. A great attitude is always appreciated, especially at brunch, in order to enhance the dining experience. A bad attitude is simply a missed opportunity. Admittedly we did chuckle after the server took a surprisingly condescending/undercover policeman tone after I ordered tequila for the bloody bar: \"IDs first, then we'll talk flavors.\" Aye aye, captain.\n",
      "\n",
      "My dining companion made the superb decision to order the Bi Bim Bap. Its Korean spicy funkiness made for an incredible flavor profile. Perfectly cooked black rice, crisp cucumbers, and a sunny side up egg solidified the dish as a slice of heaven. During the ordering process I panicked and ordered a breakfast charcuterie tray. The small selection of meats, though attractively served on a butcher block, was salty even for cured flesh. The two deviled eggs were tasty, but not impressive. I noticed that this meal has since been removed from the menu. Good choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a Bloody bar that's on fleek, and meals that consistently remind you why you're an omnivore, M&P is worth the wait.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Was sitting there for more than 20 minutes while we had our reservation a week ealier. After seated was told the big ribeye was sold out（primary reason we came here）. Service was OK, food was delicious but not as good as expected\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] So I ate at Meat & Potatoes for the first time last weekend and honestly I was so disappointed. After reading all the great reviews I had high hopes for this place but I was not impressed at all. \n",
      "First off I love the decor and the atmosphere. They really did a great job with that. \n",
      "Also the service we had was great. Our waitress was the best. I would say she was probably one of the best waitresses I've ever had at a restaurant. I give her 5 stars. \n",
      "But unfortunately the food was just not that great. They have a great idea but just something was missing and not quite all there with each dish. Don't get me wrong the food isn't bad I just don't think it's worth going back for a second time. There's so many great restaurants in Pittsburgh I don't think I'll waste my time eating @ Meat & Potatoes again.\n",
      "I do have to give props to them for the dessert. We ordered the s'mores dessert which came out in a small cast iron dish that was warm, it was awesome! If you do decide to eat here definitely order the s'mores desert.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I've been to Meat and Potatoes three times over the last few months, with the most recent time being about two weeks ago, and the summary message is this: I've been unhappy with my last couple meals.\n",
      "\n",
      "First time Dinner: Appetizers were great --- unique and tasty. Drinks were great.  My wife and I shared the awesome 34oz Ribeye for two. This ribeye is served with a 1ft bone protruding from the edge of the cutting board style serving platter.  It came with huge steak fries and their bone butter (bone marrow and butter, spices, basically)  We could not have been happier with our meal.  Service was great.  This led to me trying them for lunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lunch: I had the soft-shell-crab sandwich.  While I knew I was being somewhat adventurous ordering this, I was completely turned off by the texture of the crab. I ate less than half of it and threw it away.  Bad experience.  I chalked this one up to bad menu selection.  (I did notice, however, that this item has been removed from the lunch menu.  I wonder why?!)\n",
      "\n",
      "Second Dinner:  This time, a different couple joined us for dinner before \"Holiday Pops\" across the street at Heinz Hall.  This time I ordered the Roasted Branzino, which is basically European seabass.  While the presentation was very impressive with basically the whole fish served in a skillet with potatoes, capers, tomatoes, fennel, and artichokes there were problems with the execution.  They remove the bones by slicing the top of the fish and removing what they can through the top.  Long story short -- there were still plenty of bones in my fish.  Next, the fish was relatively small and hardly made a dinner meal for a big guy like myself.  The taste was ok, but playing around with pulling bones out of my mouth (with company) is not an experience I look forward to.\n",
      "\n",
      "All four of us were underwhelmed with our meals and there are plenty of other alternatives that do a better job.\n",
      "\n",
      "My overall impression is that service is generally good, and the cocktails served are inventive, fresh, clean, and tasty!  The food, however, seems to be style over substance and I'm just not happy at the end of the day!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Always a good place if you're looking to grab a nice dinner with a small group or even a night out with your significant other. Have tried both lunch and dinner here and both did not disappoint. Personally like the porkchop or you can't go wrong with a steak  option for dinner. I also ordered the side of Mac n cheese at lunch and it was easily one of the best I've had.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Great drink menu.  Try the Manhatten.  Everything we ate was very unique, and delicious.  The pimento mac and cheese app was cooked perfect.  We also had the flat iron steak and lamb.  Flat iron is normally code speak for cheap piece of meat, but this was a one inch thick cooked perfectly meal.\n",
      "A negative:  your neighbor table is very close to you.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] The idea of this restaurant is spot on -- high end cocktails and high end comfort food. The execution, though, is lacking. I ordered two versions of a Manhattan from their cocktail list. Great flavor, but they serve their cocktails in very wide saucer glasses. This just warms up the drinks more quickly than a smaller glass, and a warm cocktail is no one's friend. They pour their wine generously, and the glass selection is great.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had fries -- fine, but the flavored mayo that came with them lacked flavor. Then I had the harvest salad, which was nice, but strangely cold, like it had just been taken from a fridge. I liked the spare dressing, however. Next came one of the night's specials -- grilled cheese with tomato soup. The soup was great. The sandwich was cold and I only ate one bite of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe with more time they'll get their game on. The space is lovely, the servers were friendly, and the central bar is beautiful.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] The food I had was delicious the service was okay too. It's just way too crowded in there. I understand it's a popular restaurant but it's nearly impossible to walk around to even get to the table. If you don't mind the hustle and bustle I definitely recommend it but for a romantic and personable time I do not. You may as well be sitting at the same table as the people next to you.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Nice place for drinks.  However, I was not impressed with the food.  Had chicken and found it to be a low quality meal.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I know that I'm late to the party on this one, but I've been trying to be pescatarian for the past half year, so it's been a bit tough to come here. That being said, we break \"fast\" every now and then, and Meat and Potatoes is a great way to get your meat on. The name is actually quite fitting, because if you want veggies at all, this is not where you're going to find that - I think about 15% of their menu might include vegetables.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pate is phenomenal, as is the bone marrow appetizer. You'll feel full just from eating that, because it is so rich. But totally worth it. I also had duck here and it was great too. Also - try the red velvet dessert. It comes in a jar, which is really fitting because you won't be able to finish it and then you can just take it home in your purse. So, evidently I have broken \"fast\" a few times. But, why am I writing only now?\n",
      "\n",
      "Because I discovered Meat and Potatoes brunch - which is on both Saturday AND Sunday. Hear that Pittsburgh? Saturday AND Sunday. Some of you would do well to note that many of us aren't limited to brunch on Sundays!\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, I've been having a fried chicken craving for the past month or so (if you've been a dedicated meat eater for most of your life, and then go pescatarian, it catches up with you sometimes) and someone told me that Meat and Potatoes does down-to-earth goodness fried chicken and waffles. Let me tell you about the last time I had chicken and waffles. It was at midnight at the Waffle Shop in East Liberty, and the fried chicken was so bad, I left it, and the waffles tasted like cardboard. But that's another story... Needless to say, this fried chicken and waffles was PHENOMENAL. The fried chicken is perfectly breaded and cooked (you can tell them if you just want dark or light meat) and the waffle is made out of this wonderful cheese-jalapeno batter that is only the slightest bit spicy. Which comes with syrup cooked with bacon. \n",
      "\n",
      "Did you just fall over? That must be my puddle of drool you just slipped on. Sorry.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] The atmosphere was great. Good misic, lighting, and the barteners were really friendly.  We ordered a few small plates and split them between the four of us.  Drinks are reasonably priced and made really well. \n",
      "Will definitely go back next time I visit Pittsburgh.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Sunday Bloody Mary bar is incredible! Try the bacon vodka as a base, its delicious!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] What a great spot! Long weekend in Pittsburgh, and I was told this was a spot to try, so the group I was with came here for brunch on a Saturday. It wasn't overly crowded, which was nice, they were playing amazing hits from the 90s and the sun was shining through the big windows at the front of the restaurant. Meat and Potatoes doesn't want to come off pretentious, hence the name and they succeeded. Just served great food and great drinks. I had to get the chicken and waffles because they were too good to pass up, and had a rosemary infused vodka cocktail with some champagne! Delicious. Serving size was large and in charge, my friend and I could have split the chicken and waffles easily and all other meals at the table were the same. No complaints! Definitely recommend it for one meal while visiting Pittsburgh.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] We were in the mood for PROTEIN tonight so headed to meat and potatoes to find it.  Definitely a bumping place at 7 pm on Friday.  A bit too noisy for me to eat dinner, this place is probably better as a happy hour joint.  The chairs = very comfortable.  BUT you have to lean forward in them to be heard in this place.    \n",
      "\n",
      "MUSSELS OF THE DAY- traditional type.  These were tasty BUT I KNEW these were gonna be salty when we ordered and I was right.  I am feeling dehydrated hours later as I write this.  I prefer my mussels cooked in sauce that is more drinkable so you can sop it up.    \n",
      "\n",
      "PUB BURGER- I suppose there was no living up to the fantastic burger I had earlier this week at Burgatory.  This burger was a sad burger in comparison.  Not really to my liking, a little too soggy and lacking in tomato.  The fries were good, crispy and hot.    \n",
      "\n",
      "WAGYU FLAT IRON- My companion claims this was not real wagyu.  Overall it won a rating of \"OKAY\" from him but for 28 dollars, an okay is pretty sad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably will not be back.  Food didn't leave a great impression and neither did our waitress who seemed a little pissy!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I love the bar here. The bartenders are all amazing, incredibly helpful, friendly, and knowledgable. They can make you amazing drinks, and can give some great recommendations too. It can be pricey for the cocktails, but they are worth it. The craft beer selection is cheap if you're into that, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The brunch is fab, and the $5 bloody mary bar, including house-infused shots, is one of my favourite things in the universe. Just saying.\n",

      "\n",
      "You're not allowed to sit at a table and just order drinks. It doesn't matter that drinks are mostly $10+ and it doesn't matter that there are lots of open tables. I found that very rude and off-putting when I was refused a table on a Monday night because I didn't want to order food at 11pm.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Meat & Potatoes. The moment I saw this pop up on my Yelp app I knew I was going here regardless of the rating. \n",
      "\n",
      "We had brunch here and next time I'm in town I plan to get dinner here. We had the sourdough french toast, fried chicken and waffles with cheddar and jalapeno peppers and bourbon bacon syrup. Splooge. Everywhere. For the price, the quantity and quality of the food they serve is unreal. Too bad I do not have two stomachs, because if I did, I would have ordered more. Every item on the menu was something I would order.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered a black IPA but the waitress brought a regular IPA. This wasn't a huge deal for me, but when I asked her about it she said she would check on it. She never came back or offer to change it to what I ordered. I let the beer sit assuming she would switch it out but it just got warm and I drank it after realizing she either forgot or blew me off. Again, not a big deal, but this place would have been 5 stars if it weren't for that.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] The food, cocktails and beer selection is great. Most of the stuff on the main courses are very good especially the pork dish and the huge ribeye they have. I took one star off as they tend to lose orders in the kitchen on a frequent basis. Great lively atmosphere.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Well, I know I'm in the minority here, which is ok by me... but I hoped for so much more when we came here. I guess I'm just too much of a traditionalist for a place like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't get me wrong, the food was cooked perfect. My favorite part of the meal was the bone marrow and the tenderness of the steak. So good. I just got lost on the grits and collard greens & pickled mushrooms that were served with it.  Like I said, I'm just too much of a Steak and Potato person to appreciate the variety of the plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was great, she knew all about the dishes and made recommendations. The atmosphere was good, music in the background and not too bright or dark for the lighting.  The seating, well, the seating was like we were in a group, RIGHT next to the people beside us. So close that the guy next to me jokingly was going to try my dessert! (it was hilarious but his wife was annoyed. haha!)\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Coming in for restaurant week, we found that atmosphere to be pretty casual with some good music in the background and almost a full house. Service was also pretty timely with decent wait times between food servings. From the presentation of the food, you could tell that the chefs really paid attention to how things came together. \n",
      "\n",
      "Taken individually, each item would probably have been a 5-star dish. The confit chicken thigh was nice and tender with a nice side salad mixed in. The mac and cheese was very flavorful and surprisingly filling despite its small size. And who could complain about the pork chop with pork belly, a huge portion of meat that went perfectly with the squash grits, not to mention the roasted apple with foie gras on the side? \n",
      "\n",
      "The only problem in the end was that taken together, we found the meal to be a bit on the heavy side. Something lighter like a soup instead of the mac would have worked well. Or if the mac had been removed and replaced with a dessert at the end. Maybe even a smaller portion of the pork chop/belly, and a different pairing for the foie gras or apple. For the entree, having both pork belly and foie gras on the same plate definitely became a bit hard to swallow comfortably, particularly after the cheesy mac. But for anyone who was able to enjoy the entire meal, I'd say it was definitely worth the price.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] This place gets a 5 solely for atmosphere, cocktails and menu. Although what I ordered did not impress, I really enjoyed the whole experience.\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] We were in town for one night. We looked online and could not get in until 9pm. I called and talked to the front desk and they were able to squeeze us in at 6:45. Very small place but very cool experience. Thank you to the staff for treating us like regulars.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I have only visited Meat & Potatoes once, and for the most part it was a great experience. The food is inspired. I ate eggs in purgatory, and my date had chicken and waffles. I was delighted by my dish which truly brought me to heaven. I was jealous of my date's meal, though it more appropriately should be called \"A Chicken with and waffles.\" Seriously though, it was more food than either of us could handle, and made a lovely chicken salad throughout the rest of the week.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is indisputable that the food and cocktails hit the spot. However the atmosphere makes the speak-easy vibe fall short. The high ceilings, metal riveted ceilings reminiscent of Walmart, and overly packed space ultimately disservice the intimacy created by the seating and mirrors that I am guessing the establishment is striving for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the ever so slight problems with the architecture, this spot is not one to miss. Located within the cultural district, this a happening, distinguished yet casual restaurant where you nearly feel transported to another time with food that is out of this world!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Had a great table here for our group of eight. A semi private area with a long natural wood table. Ambience is a great mix of chic and natural which is perfect for their food.\n",
      "\n",
      "My dinner mates had the Wagyu beef and said it was one of the best steaks they ever had. I would 100% agree from just the one bite I had. With the grits and collard greens it was one excellent bite.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the pappardelle based on the server's recommendation but was a but disappointed. The dish had chunks of meat and a chunky tomato pancetta sauce but the flavor was a bit more basic than I expected. The noodles were great but overall it was just ok. Wish I had the beef!\n",

      "Definitely worth a try and it appears Sunday nights are a good secret in terms of avoiding the crowds!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I had eaten here before, so I booked an alumni event here for roughly 40 people. I could not have been happier with the result: amazing food, delicious drinks and a fun, private atmosphere (back room). They even created a custom drink for us based on an Ohio bar's recipe. The restaurant was extremely accommodating and flexible with what we wanted for the event. I highly recommend booking a smaller event here for something casual yet sophisticated.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Elegantly casual!! Never had an experience like this before. Seating was awkward but the food was unique and memorable. Must try Meat  and Potatoes !\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Gastro Pub at its best!!  Great food, friendly staff and amazing cocktails.  Before a show, after a show, or really any time is the right time for Meat & Potatoes.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Amazing. The food was beyond expectation and the service is top notch. Nice beer selection and cocktail list.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Over all a great experience.

      "Only negatives for me were the place is tiny !! Get a reservation unless you are okay with eating at the bar. Also not really my scene. Bartenders and everyone else in there looked like overly trendy hipsters.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Seriously great food and a unique atmosphere.  I've traveled the world and I have never seen another restaurant like it.  I just want to know who gives 3 stars because the place didn't have hot chocolate??? (Lauren C.) Does this place even look like it serves hot chocolate?? I mean really...  You might as well have asked for a Capri Sun.\n",

      "I struggled with the menu choices. Everything sounded amazing and I wish I could have tried a bite of each dish. But I also thought I could get really good fish tacos, or pasta or cheese plates elsewhere. I was secretly craving pizza, so I lingered on the flatbread list. I decided on the mushroom/truffle. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you a vegetarian?\" the bartender asked when I ordered. \"No, not really,\" I replied. \"Then don't get the mushroom,\" he said. After all, the place is called \"Meat and Potatoes.\" So I asked for a small order of the fried taters with truffle mayo and the short rib (braised beef, bleu cheese) flatbread.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Belgian-style frites were great, but I ate half of them and used the truffle mayo as a dip for the light, flaky, how-did-they-do-it buttery flatbread crust. The beef was tender and paired well with the cheeses and spicy greens. The pickled red onions were sweet and could have been sliced much thinner. Carmelized may have been a better option. Roasted, diced beets could have also given it a pop of red and and earthy note. Overall delicious. \n",
      "\n",
      "The guys next to me at the bar were drinking the bartender's rum old fashioneds. A fan of brandy old fashioneds, I gave the cocktail a chance after learning the bar didn't have Korbel brandy (nope). Allspice syrup was the key to making this impossibly tiny, impossibly strong, impossibly delicious cocktail taste like Christmas and the solution for world peace. A common spice for braised beef, it paired well with the short rib flatbread. Ask for it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Probably shouldn't go here if you're in a BIG hurry to eat or make the curtain call at one of the area theaters. Even at the bar, service was slow and the place was packed (reservations are pretty key here). But this place lends itself to taking your time, slipping slowly, and enjoying well-crafted food. As casual-hip as it was inspired, I had a great meal. So glad I went.\n",

I asked if they could move my table he said no. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE, ill spend money on my clients else where!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] We went here for my fiance's birthday. I called ahead and she asked me if we were there for any special occasion. I told her yes, for a birthday, and asked if they do anything special. The girl on the phone laughed and said no, \"you have to pay for dessert\". I wasn't looking for free food, but was hoping for a special table, candle, etc. Otherwise, why did she bother to ask?\n",
      "\n",
      "We got there and the waitress offered me a drink (my fiance was parking the car). She read me the draft beers and offered to come back to take a drink order. We were seated at a small, wobbly table for 2. It was so small, that it couldn't fit our entire order on it, and the waitress told us she had to \"map out\" how to deliver our food, so that it could all fit on the table. \n",
      "\n",
      "Once my fiance was seated, we ordered the curry mussels. They were fantastic. I could almost drink the broth alone without the mussels.They were seasoned with red curry, what tasted like cilantro, and had a little bite to the aftertaste. We then ordered fried pickles (amazing breading, not too thick, and didn't fall off), devils on horseback (dates stuffed with sausage wrapped in bacon with a sweet red pepper sauce. Definitely more sweet than we imagined), and poutine (cheese curd was good on them). \n",
      "\n",
      "My fiance decided on the lamb burger. It was delicious and juicy. It had a good lamb flavor and the bread was fresh and didn't tear. There was some sort of sauce on the burger, which was had good depth of flavor. It came with fries; the fries were fries. Nothing out of this world, but tasty.\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided on the mushroom risotto. It was perfect. Flavors were delicious and the texture was creamy. It was a small plate and I was full, but not so full that I couldn't move, which usually happens when I eat here. It was a good portion size.\n",
      "\n",
      "We weren't impressed with the desserts. We were looking for something light, and all they had was chocolate. The \"lightest\" thing they had, was some type of orange creamcicle dessert, and neither of us are fans. They change the desserts daily, so I was unable to order what I had last time I was there, and loved. To be honest, it was disappointing that we did not have dessert, given that we were there to celebrate a birthday. It would be nice if they had some type of standard dessert to accommodate several different pallets, that way everyone leaves happy.\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Went there before the stadium series hockey game so area was packed with visitors. It required reservation to get a table on this Saturday afternoon keep that in mind if visiting on a high tourism time. On Saturday they were serving a brunch and not their menu you see on line. I was disappointed since I saw items on menu I wanted to try but was. It able to. My wife had the shrimp and grits said it was best she had ever has. I had pub burger with pastrami pork belly. Burger was good maybe too much not the kind of burger you pick up and eat a little messy but still very good. We shared and cheesecake apple crunch, not exactly what it real name. It was also very good. We would definitely come back.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I have to say that I am a little disappointed with Meat & Potatoes.

      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] One of my favorite high end restaurants in town.

      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Menu is really limited. The prices are just too high for what you get! The music is ridiculously loud. They are not really customer focused as they are busy. But, a repeat customer I will not be.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I really enjoy this place. Ambiance is fantastic. Just the right lighting, cool space, nice bar which is the center piece and should be because the bartenders are top notch. Drinks are not the average bottle slinging. Anything off the menu is an experience though the special was too smokey like eating a piece of wood out of the fire. However no uppity BS, she took it back and made me another. \n",
      "\n",
      "Had the special which was the chacatuire as an app with the fried Brussel sprouts. Both were outstanding. For main course we had the special strip which was also fantastic. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the waygu was way too fatty and not well seasoned. Dessert was phenomenal. Chocolate pecan pie and the chocolate mousse. Both of them were so good we nearly ordered another. \n",

      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] In Pittsburgh for one night looking for a place near my hotel and found this place.   I was blown away.  I had a local brew with the chicken livers to start,  I've never had chicken livers like this.  They were light and so delicious with out any of the typical liver aftertaste served with a great sauce with a nice spicy kick.   My entre was the wagyu steak, very nicely done.   So much on their menu to explore I will be back.   Reasonable prices too....large appetizer of livers was only $7.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Considering the name I figured they would have some obvious meat and potato options on the menu and was very disappointed. Ordered the Waygu Flat Iron and portion sizes for my meal and other guests were incredibly small considering the prices. $12 Mac and cheese entree came with short ribs on it and was a larger portion than all of the entrees. \n",
      "\n",
      "Food was extremely salty and not very flavorful. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the restaurant is very small with tables so close surrounding the bar that you cannot pass somebody if you are coming or going and servers clog up the aisles. It is really more of a bar with some hgher-end, higher-prices bar/grill type items.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I've heard nothing but great things about this place and I was so excited to go.  I think I even made up a song about how excited I was to go.  Once I got there I was not disappointed.  The decor wasn't quite what I expected, but not bad.  The food was great.  We started with the kobe corn dog and fried brussel sprouts.  The corn dog wasn't really better than the best corn dog I've had before in my life but the fried brussel sprouts were something new and delicious.  They were crispy on the outside but still juicy on the inside.  My boyfriend got the pot roast and I got he pastrami crusted duck.  His pot roast was good, but I had to protect my duck from him after he tried a bite.  I have never tasted anything like it.  The combination of flavors made you keep searching for more.  It was rich without being too rich and the saurkraut pierogis that came with it was a great balance to the duck.  I highly reccomend this place to anyone who enjoys classic food in a way that you've never experienced it before.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered some of their specialty drinks, two that were gin based.  I can't recall their names now but they were not my favorite thing on the menu.  Dessert was a \"pot de creme\" which was the perfect amount of sweetness after my meal.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] T and I followed the great Yelp reviews to Meat and Potatoes for a Saturday morning brunch. Wow. First of all, I want to move in to this place. If I could choose a restaurant's decor, this would be it. Sexy velvet, white ceramic animals, metal curio cabinets, and a gorgeous white fireplace. Yes please! We made a reservation but wound up getting there about 15 minutes late. (We called to tell them we'd be late.) We expected a bit of a wait but were happy to be seated immediately upon arrival.\n",
      "\n",
      "While perusing the menu, the waitress brought over big mugs of coffee and described the specials which included a Pastry of the Day. Tip to all brunch restaurants, have a Pastry of the Day. This particular day it was described as a criossant monkey bread with a Krispy Kreme glaze twist. Needless to say, we ordered it. I could have had this and a cup of coffee and walked away satisfied. It was fresh, soft, crispy, sweet. Exactly as described as a Krispy Kreme monkey bread. Holy cow. They should put this on the menu permanently. \n",
      "\n",
      "T got the huevos ranchero and I got the French toast. The huevos ranchero were great, cheesy and spicy. I found the black beans a touch bland but that was my only complaint. My French toast was amazing and came with bacon almond brittle. Yum! My only complaint was my own doing. I had sweet upon sweet and I should have ordered a savory breakfast since we got the pastry. But that's my own fault. I definitely want to go back the next time we're in Pittsburgh to try other dishes, in particular the chicken and waffles. The owners of this place are opening another spot soon and I'd definitely like to check that out as well!\n",

      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Food was fantastic. The tartare was exceptional....if you are debating between it and the bone marrow for an appetizer, don't: it comes served on top of a bone filled with delicious marrow. One gripe, I purposefully seek \"gastropubs\" for the food typical of them, but also for a high-end beer selection which defines a gastropub as such. Meat and Potatoes fails on this front. Half of their beers are the type you find in big box grocers (Miller, Pabst, Tecate, Molson, etc,). The other half are domestic craft beers, none of which are particularly notable.  No belgian beers, no imports (unless you count the big corporate beers like Stella Artois and Boddingtons), and NO BEERS  ON DRAFT. This is sort of a requirement for a pub, much less a gastropub. However, if you are into the mixology, high-end cocktail scene, this place has you covered.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] PLAN AHEAD AND MAKE A RESERVATION. I was visiting Pittsburgh for a few days and I knew I wanted to eat here, but I didn't think of making a reservation ahead of time. Don't be like me. Make a reservation before you get there. You don't want to waste your time waiting for a table, hoping there is a no show. Luckily, I called again another day and they were able to seat us in the \"back room\" within 20 minutes on a Saturday evening! The back room is separate from the main dining area so you miss out on the amazing ambiance, but you still get to order from the same menu. \n",

      "We had a group of 4 and decided to order a bunch of dishes and share so we could try a little bit of everything. We ordered:\n",
      "--Meat and Potatoes: 34 oz ribeye with sautéed mushrooms, bone marrow, and (mutant) potato wedges. Highly recommend sharing this with more than 2 people so you don't waste any food. The ribeye was meaty, cooked just right at medium rare, flavorful, succulent and fatty. Cut a piece of ribeye and top it off with bone marrow for extra flavor and extra fat. :)\n",
      "--Caesar Salad: This salad comes with fried pork ears. It's delicious! Love the home made Caesar dressing too. \n",
      "--Mussels of the day with garlic bread: Get it! There were 3 different flavors to choose from. They give you a ton of mussels! \n",
      "--Lobster Mac: It was good but I wouldn't order it again. They give you large chucks of lobster. \n",
      "--Pork Belly Tacos: delicious!!! The tortilla is so yummy and you can feel the pork crunch and melt in your mouth. \n",
      "\n",
      "I love the ambiance of this place. It's a great place for a date night. Order a few drinks and some plates to share for a great night. I love the romantic vibe this places gives off. Round marble tables with candlelight centerpiece gives off an intimate vibe for a nice sit down dinner.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I have to thank my son and his wife for turning me onto this gem of a restaurant. They have great service and great food. It's best to call and make a reservation in advance, especially on Fridays and weekends..I love their Muscles with curry sauce . The steaks are excellent and I haven't had anything there I didn't like. The menu is sophisticated but not overwhelming. The staff has always been accommodating and willing to help with selections or nutritional preferences. If you have a date this is the place to go for dinner then a movie. I think you'll like the Outcome. If not, he or she was not for you.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] the marrow was absolutely amazing. Turned my hubby into a convert.  Go and get the \"meat butter\". It is totally worth it. The rest of dinner was great as well.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] What a great restaurant! My husband and I shared the mushroom flatbread with truffles, ricotta, and arugula. I then ordered the pasta bolognese (incredible!) and he had the sweetbread piccatta. The pasta was full of flavor and very filling, and the sweetbreads were tender and cooked perfectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also enjoyed their interesting cocktail (I tried the aperol-ade, a very refreshing drink.) The atmosphere is cozy, although maybe a bit loud and crowded. I would suggest going late, on a week night, and make sure to make a reservation.\n",

      "I'm so excited to go back and try something new on the menu--everything sounds so delicious!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Our server could barely communicate the specials because of the loud music. My brunch was a breakfast americano. The sausage was dry and overcooked. The eggs were not done as I had asked and the bread was soaked in butter. I just ate the potato gratin and left hungry. When I went to use their restroom there was no soap in the bathroom and saw one of their servers leave without washing their hands. I would not come back here. I would leave zero stars if possible.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] It's a surprisingly small space and despite a number of bar seats it still appears impossible to get one.  Make a reservation, don't count calories, and enjoy.  Artisan cocktails are outstanding, definitely the best I've had in Pittsburgh and they easily measure up against my home town of New Orleans.  The wine and beer lists are also very well chosen so just about everyone will be happy (other than my colleague who always orders Bud Light, which they don't carry here).\n",
      "\n",
      "On the appetizer menu, poutine is fantastic (and this is coming from someone who worked in Montreal for a year) if you like the combination of fries, cheese curds & brown gravy.  The lobster spring roll was really good, and the tartare was also excellent - let's just say there are very few places that I would ever order tartare but this is one.  The Fall Salad is also great and the sashimi was fine but didn't blow me away.  In terms of main courses the signature 34 ounce ribeye (which most restaurants would call a \"Tomahawk\" or \"Cowboy\" cut) was shared by my table on my initial visit and I have to say the meat was cooked perfectly and had great flavor but overall it just had way too much fat.  Of course, the accompanying fries and bone marrow gratin were also good.  The surprise hit of the meal however was the pasta - great homemade papardelle with a perfect short rib bolognese sauce and very good agnolotti with a brown butter sauce and some veggies although the shape & size of the pasta wasn't typical for agnolotti.  The short rib flatbread was also very good and the only real miss on 2 visits so far was a mushroom flatbread that had a strange ricotta spread for the cheese and just didn't have much flavor.  Nothing is perfect but everything from the decor to the service to the food are done well at Meat & Potatoes and I'll definitley be back - assuming I can get a reservation.\n",

The very first impression when we walked in the restaurant was great. The environment and ambiance were amazing. The place has a nice atmosphere that prepares you for the food experience to come. Service is nice, fast and helpful. Everything we tried was great and I have to recommend the three pigs sandwich. Also the plates we saw in other tables seemed delicious as well. We will definitely visit this place again and I am highly recommending it!\n",

I wish I could get in here more often but I just might go broke. Had some excellent cocktails, I figured hey I don't drink wild drinks that often so I asked the bartender to make me something with bourbon. Whatever he made me was incredible, I think he told me it was called pushing up daisies or something along those lines. \n",

      "Once we were seated, definitely need reservations here, which we had. We had some risotto as an appetizer. This actually should have been my main course. It was perfectly cooked and so creamy owww! Then next was a steak and rib entree, which I ordered medium-rare, once again on point and so delicious. The special lady ordered the pot pie, And I have to admit it was the best pot pie I have ever had and to top it off it was so large I ended up eating for another 2 days afterwords. \n",

      "The only thing that was sort of stupid was that I got charged $0.75 for a to go jar for my desert? What gives ?! I just spent over $100 not including tip and your going to pull a  maneuver like that. I mean what's $0.75 on top of my $40 bar tab and $75 dinner bill. It's just the point of it all. I still love this place anyway. The people and service are great and the food kicks butt too!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] My favorite bunch spot with yummy offerings and of course the bloody mary bar. I have never had anything that I didn't like here, even taking some picky eaters with me at times. I highly recommend this trendy Pittsburgh spot.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Food was great. I had Irish eggs Benedict and bf had brisket flatbread. Absolutely delicious. And decent price. Decor in here is great too. Service was ok. Nothing outstanding. \n",
      "Atmosphere- tables of 2 behind the bar are very tightly spaced. I felt like I was dining with the couples next to us. Also the bar directly behind us and in line of sight had all the dirty glasses stacked in a corner. At least 15 of then just sitting on the corner. Bar patrons seemed to take note of the unsightly stack too. More and more got added and none were picked up to be cleaned.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] I enjoyed the three pigs sandwich and pimento Mac and cheese more than some people were enjoying their dates.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] First time to Pittsburgh and this place has me falling in love...along with the PPG building because that thing is beautiful and kickass.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took my sales rep and sales engineer out for a team-building dinner to this place after seeing it on the Travel Channel.  It is a small place but we were seated at a nice table in the corner by the windows.  Our server was fairly attentive but not great.  My cocktails were good but not memorable.\n",
      "\n",
      "To start, we had devils on horseback, poutine, and the kobe corndog.  My favorite was the corndog with the chipotle sauce - just divine meaty and spicy.  The fries in the poutine were crispy and soaked up the savory gravy well, with the curds squeaking properly against the teeth.  Devils on horseback needed some cheese or the bacon needs to be crispier because there was a slight texture issue while the flavour was robust.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fried brussel sprouts were nicely charred and I snuck a pieces of chicharrone and crispy pig ear from the caesar salads.  The three of us also shared the 34 oz bone-in ribeye with mushrooms, steak fries, and bone marrow gratin.  I was a little disappointed that the ribeye was not medium-rare but more medium and the quality wasn't the best.  However, it was impressive looking and the steak fries were incredibly tasty, along with God's butter (aka bone marrow).\n",
      "\n",
      "The dessert was a huge disappointment, as I ordered the salted caramel pretzel brownie.  It came out parfait-style but was so incredibly dry and the mouthfeel was similar to soft gravel.  I would not recommend ordering dessert here.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR - fun smallish gastropub requiring reservations that mostly has great food but service needs to perk up with more personality and dessert needs a major overhaul.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Went for lunch and ordered the Turkey Melt-it was laden with layers of dense, dry turkey and I couldn't even cut through the bottom layer of bread, never did find out whether it was burnt or otherwise. Left 3/4 of it on the plate.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] The chicken and waffles were DRY. I like the idea of having an entire chicken served on top of a waffle, but the breading was flavorless and one of the pieces was pink on the inside.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Wife and I always get the meant and potatoes for 2. We also get an additional serving of bone marrow. We never finish our steak because it's so huge. Totally awesome food tho!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Make a reservation and this place is sure to please. The food is great the the decor has a great vibe. \n",
      "\n",
      "My only complaint was its a little small and crowded.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Overall: An excellent lunch and dinner experience. The service accommodating, the drinks well-balanced, and the food savory, if slightly rich. An easy choice for Pittsburgh fine-dining.\n",
      "__________________________________________\n",
      "Ambiance (4/5): One room and large, so it doesn't get to \"chill\", but otherwise very relaxed, festive, and modern, if a little chatty from the other guests and expansive from the very-large bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "one room and a small private table with door, industrial feel with pipes and low-power lights hanging from the high ceilings above. bar of 20. high ceilings, rustic wall mounts of deer heads, greens hang from lights for Christmas, tree lit in corner. Soft ambiance play from above, hum to the place.\n",
      "__________________________________________\n",
      "Service (4/5): Prompt, if stand-off, arguably \"know it all\" in delivery, but exceptionally accommodating during lunch and overall very genial and helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediate water and refills, long list of suggestions with general portion sizes indicated. Recommendations were as described. Took a bit of time delivering between appetizers though restaurant fairly packed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I returned for lunch the next day.. 35 minutes after the kitchen had closed! I placed an order at 1:55, they cooked it and put it at the bar. It was still warm, waiting, when I arrived at 2:35. I never felt rushed sitting down this late, and they accommodated me perfectly.\n",

      "Drinks (5/5): Mixed drinks have a fantastic balance of flavor, alcohol, and texture. Small craft beer selection.\n",
      "\n",
      "1) sloe gin fizz - awesome lightness with gin and citrus, juniper a bit lost but consistency creamy with egg. Fantastic stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Sgt peppers old fashioned - bitters and orange work well together, pull out bourbon oak and heat while tempering. Pepper keeps drink light, very low sugar presence compared to sometimes over sweetened profile. One of the best old fashioneds I've drank. Another winner!\n",
      "__________________________________________\n",
      "Food (4/5): Aside from a few textural shortcuts and missteps, this is excellent cuisine, both lunch and dinner. Rich and hearty yet balanced and inventive, I look forward to trying another round.\n",
      "\n",
      "1) tartare - spicy from the chili bowl-glaze and Jalapeno crunch! Soft boiled egg sits atop (done perfectly). Seaweed definitely noticeable. Light onion as well. Quality meat, lighter smoke unnoticeable unless you separate from fixins. Peanut adds a distinguished crunch though the flavor contrasts a bit. Lighter, more conflicted from so many ingredients, not as rustic or simple. I prefer softer texture of bittering agents like arugula, black pepper, and capers to the harsher texture here, and the spice heat slightly hides meat, but very good stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Bone marrow - rich, fatty melt in mouth, nice use of salt, white onion, caper to cut richness though still a lot. Bread is hearty, absorbs marrow easily, but could be a bit crisper, though richness may overpower otherwise and sopping marrow out of bone is made easier. The coarse sea-salt is a textural issue against the marrow. It's gritty and cracks as the marrow melts in your mouth while you attempt chewing the bread.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Tort sandwich - really crunchy bread. Light! Avocado cuts jalapeno sting, pork fat, radishes maintain levity. Waves of flavor, first light jalapeno and pickled radish, then brash mango aioli and avocado, light pork and smoke following as spice builds, before the toasty crunch finish. Really subtle, in control. Lightly dry without aioli.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Mac and cheese - served in mini cast iron! thick! Lightly sweet, little burnt aspect so low textural contrast. Light influence from chorizo, hearty lightly stinging. Really solid and rich, though texturally a bit boring. She agreed.. \"thick, rich\"..\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] This place is my absolute favorite place to eat in Pittsburgh!! I tell everyone I know who travels to the 'burgh to make reservations in advance. I could easily gush about everything on their menu and their specialty drinks, but one of my favorite things is the bloody mary bar on a Sunday morning. Can't wait for my next trip back :)\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] They seemed to have increased the brunch prices across the board (at least the last time I was there). One of the best things about this place was its affordability, and it's just a bit more expensive now. Still a solid menu, and still a relatively inexpensive brunch option in Pittsburgh.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Fantastic brunch choice! I had the grilled cheese w soup. It said tomato soup on the menu but it really wasn't. The soup it went w was celery or potato soup w pickles! It tasted wonderful! Cheese is good as always. I will try dinner this weekend! Also the libation choice is rich. I tried the lavender and I LOVED it.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Really solid place. Great ambiance and pretty good service. Food is outstanding, highly recommend the \"meat and potatoes for 2\". A great deal and some of the best steak you will have. The potatoes are without a doubt the best take on french fries I've ever had. The bone marrow was amazing too. Great cocktail list too, or so I'm told. Certainly a must-try!\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] This is a fun place in a great location in the Cultural District.  The food is very good, and the decor is charming.  The service is fairly quick, and the wait staff is very polite and helpful.  I was surprised at the devils on horseback, which turned out to be a very delicious appetizer...and something I was not expecting at a place called \"Meat and Potatoes.\"  I have heard people rave about the good food here, and it turns out to be very good and there are some fun choices, however it's certainly not the best Pittsburgh has to offer.\n",
      "Steakhouses ['Food', 'Meat Shops', 'Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Specialty Food', 'Gastropubs', 'American (New)'] Excellent excellent excellent. Went for the brunch and ordered the chicken and waffles. One of the best breakfasts I have ever had, hands down. The amount of food for the price is stellar. Massive cheddar jalapeño pepper waffle with four huge pieces of chicken and bacon maple syrup. Start with truffle potatoes!!! MAKE A RESERVATION AND GET OVER HERE TO EAT NOW.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Pizza was excellent. We ordered two pepperoni pizzas with sausage and garlic sauce along with two house baked Italian subs. One of the best in the area.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Public Service Announcement: \n",
      "DO NOT order from Vocellis Pizza on Baum Blvd in Oakland. My order took over an hour and the cashier said \"we are too fu*cking busy to be waiting on your faggot asses.\" I asked him for his name to report it, and he said it was Deshawn. He then repeatly yelled \"get yo faggot ass out my fucking store\"....\n",
      "\n",
      "Yup... its 2017 and that just happened.... so I snapped his picture  (public shame time bitch )\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] This was a delivery order for:\n",
      "\n",
      "Pepperoni Pizza\n",
      "Hot Wings\n",
      "\n",
      "Pizza the texture and flavor of cardboard. Wings were covered in black pepper. I just do not understand why anyone would order from them other than the fact that they are open late.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Bar none, worst pizza experience I have ever received. Pizza showed up BLACK!. Please DO NOT ORDER HERE. This was my first time trying this place. Also asked for extra sauce on the side, of course that didn't happen. Please save your money and do not order from this place. I have pictures to prove it.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I'm surprised at the amount of bad reviews here. I always love their pizza and wings. Although there is inconsistency in quality of pizza sometimes, the wings are always good. Whenever I have pizza cravings this is my go to place.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] If I could give this place no stars, I would. The food is average. Just as average as any other pizza place around. But Vocelli cancelled our order because they don't deliver to certain places (not even a half mile from their store) after certain times. \n",
      "\n",
      "They didn't have the decency to call me and ask if I'd pick it up, they lied and said they didn't have a delivery driver, which they DO, so they wouldn't have to drive to the hill district. Classy.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] 4 stars for a chain pizza joint - you betcha ya.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm pretty picky about Pizza and let's face it most chains pizza is not very good. Vocelli's is different, not do they different crusts to choose from they have their gourmet pizza selection which beats all other chains hands down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plus they have always been fast and after getting pies from 2 different stores they have had good consistency.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] My two experiences here show what a difference customer service can make: like night and day. Though my first encounter with a Vocelli employee was abysmal, my second interaction more than redeemed them in my eyes. \n",
      "\n",
      "A man who's name I shamefully can't remember called me out of the blue Saturday night and apologized for the extremely rude way I had been treated by his colleague, and then he asked if he could bring me a free pizza as an apology. I said yes, and not only did he show up with a free pizza, but he was delightful to talk to and the kind of representative any business would be proud to have dealing with customers. Oh, and also, he showed up with TWO pizzas, both of which were pretty good. Apology accepted, Vocelli Pizza, and special thanks to the delightful guy who I spoke with, who has transformed me from a boycotter to a repeat customer. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hopefully I won't have to deal with that jerk from my first encounter too often, but any business that stands behind both its product and its service the way Vocelli did the other night is the kind of business that's worth giving a second chance. Unfortunately the receipt only provided the name of the original jerk I dealt with and not the person from my last encounter, so I can't provide the name specifically. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hopefully Vocelli can find out who this lovely person was and reward him for completely turning around my view of this establishment!\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I hated this place as a kid, but I keep it in rotation as an adult. \n",
      "\n",
      "I always have my food delivered. The delivery guys are fine, not creepy like the domino guys. The food is always hot and looks tasty. \n",
      "\n",
      "The rating would have been higher if the prices were a little cheaper, they used to have great deals when I was an undergraduate. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sidenote- the wings are baked, so they are soft and saucy, not crispy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The few times they have screwed up my order, they offered more food, but not a refund.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worth a try.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] For a chain, I have to say YUM.  Sometimes out of desperation, I admit I have to turn to Domino's and other chains but I have no problem when I have to turn to Vocelli.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I have never had anything bad here, delivery is always prompt, and I am always getting special offers in my email box (enabling me to want to get it more).  If you want to get a solid pie with good service, Vocelli is better than your basic chain in aol ways!\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I am a fan because of the pizza and cheese sticks with sausage and marinara. The wings are good too.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] If all you care about is a hot pie then you have absolutely no taste. The service was par, but slow considering we ordered delivery from down the street. A cheese pizza is easier to make than teen pregnancy. The only thing that I like chewy is a four foot tall Chelsea Handler side kick. Ranch nor wine could save such a poor demonstration of corporate mismanagement. I highly recommend Pizza Romano in Oakland - ask for Lexi.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Quite possibly the worst pizza I've ever had.  Other locations were always ok with really good salads and decent pizza for the type of chain it is. Not the case here. Pizza was over cooked making the crust look like the color of a desert landscape. Beige, dry, hard to eat and tasteless. The sauce didn't even have the Vocelli recipe flavor. Waited over and hour to have wretched food delivered under half mile away. My stomach was upset for hours after eating it.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] This place never disappoints! Been coming here since I was a kid and they're awesome. Way better choice than senor taco.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] Had the steak mini tacos. Fresh and simple. Fresh cilantro was nice.\n",
      "\n",
      " The service was fast and friendly. Nice gem!\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] We got the 3 taco carne Asada combo as a late night snack. Beef was not very tender, and the portion size for rice and beans was pretty small. For the price, $8.65, I thought there would be more. Rice was good, beans were a bit dry. Overall, better places to go, but if you are in pinch, and need a quick drive through, it will do.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] I'd never been here until last night and its really close to my house. So, we gave it a shot last night and it was pretty good (at least what I had). The prices are good and the food was ready fast. The only problem was that the pollo asado burrito one of us got was really salty and made up mostly of onions. The person eating it gave up halfway through. I really liked my rice and bean burrito though. \n",
      "\n",
      "Four stars!\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] First time! It wasnt awful but it wasn't great! Too many raw onions on their chicken tacos. The tortilla was authentic but the asada that was rolled inside lacked flavor. I doubt I will give it a 2nd try.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] The breakfast burritos are solid, homemade tortillas and the chorizo is excellent. Good prices, and a fast drive thru too.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] Have only had their ham, egg, and cheese burrito and also got the super breakfast burrito today. Honestly really good and portion was really good too. Their salsa bar is great with two salsas. (Red and green) also have peppers to bag up and take home which are also very good. Service is always fast and friendly. Flattop they cook on was super clean. When you work in the kitchen you notice and appreciate these things!\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] First time here and liked it very much!  The shredded beef tacos are big and delicious my kids loved the beans and rice.  Chips and the salsa bar are excellent.  Definitely will be back!  It could use a little redecorating but all in all, our favorite fast food Mexican restaurant.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] I've lived in Arizona for 35 years, I saw Filiberto's rise and decline in quality ingredients.  This place is the opposite of poor quality.  I've eaten here twice in the past week. Carne asada burrito was delicious and hot, like they just cooked the beef.  I just had carnitas tacos with rice and beans. All of it was very good. Carnitas had flavor and it wasn't like eating pork jerky.  I want more of those tacos right now.  I live in Mesa and have now made this a stop any time I'm on the west side or passing through.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] Consistently pretty solid. Would be an easy 5-stars if they would actually put the french fries in the fryer for  California burritos instead of trying to cook the on the flat-top.\n",
      "\n",
      "The carne asada here is very good, and a nice change from the typical char-grilled smaller pieces that you find in Arizona. If you're accustomed to \"So-Cal\" style Mexican, this is a solid find. The drive through and late weekend hours are very convenient!\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] This place blows every \"bertos\" Mexican food place outta the water. Carne Asada is AMAZING. The tortillas are fresh. Try it! You won't be disappointed.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] Been here several times for breakfast and lunch. Pretty good food. The setting on the inside seems a little cheap, but it is what it is. A simple little Mexican joint to get your Mexican food fill. If they only served beer! Lol\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] One of the best in the West Valley. Carne asada burritos are awesome. Street tacos, rolled tacos are exceptional. highly recommend this eatery.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] LOVE THIS PLACE! Been coming here for years. Always great, friendly service and the best food in town! Never had a bad experience here. Our food is always hot, fresh, and the best quality. Why go anywhere else? Breakfast burritos are big and filling. Lunch we always get rolled tacos with guacamole. Yum yum! Our kids love all the quesadillas and burritos. Thank you Ramiro's for feeding us for years and we look forward to more years to come!\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] I had the carne asada burrito once before and was just barley decent. I returned a second time because it was the only non fast food chain spot that was in the area and needed something quick! \n",
      "\n",
      "Carne asada burrito tasted a little funny, a little off, undercooked maybe? \n",
      "Of course minutes later the cold sweats start the nausea, the runs.. food poisoned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unless you want to spend the rest of your day with bubble guts having self in the bathroom avoid coming here.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] I love this place, food is great and so is the price. I dont know how many times i've stopped in here with friends after a heavy night of drinking to sober up. Hits the spot with the Carne Asada burritos!!\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] Beans just like my gramma use to make!! I enjoyed everything about this restaurant, quality of the food is great, and the people are so sweet !! This place definitely has my business !!!\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] MEH. This place is ok...but after having had Senor Tacos, I wouldn't ever go here again.  Do yourself a favor, drive a couple more blocks to Senor Taco\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] I love how they have quality food for a great price. Senior taco and filibertos have nothing on Ramiro's.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] We love this place. We get take out and the girls at window are always friendly and food is awesome! Tacos, tostadas, burritos, everything has been great! Fast and fresh tasting everytime weve stopped by!\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] Looking for something quick and easy on Yelp, and found this place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost didn't order as the place was empty, but we were starving so figured what the hey.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the fish burrito which was huge and absolutely delicious, and Hubby had the Chimichanga. The rice and beans were very tasty, my fish was perfect. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the guacamole. Too smooth and kinda weird. Tasted okay, but if I meet a guacamole I don't finish, then it's not perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll definitely go back and give it another try. Restaurant seemed pretty clean to us, despite what other Yelpers have seen. Maybe they read the reviews and got the place tidied up.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] On My Goodness!!! And I mean REAL GOOD!!! ....they were actually mashing the refried beans as we walked in !!!! \n",
      "Totally Homemade and authentic Mexican Food!!! \n",
      "Enjoyed the Flavors ....they even have a drive thru! \n",
      "Really recommend this place!!!\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] what a great gem. we ordered 8 street tacos and of different kinds. All were great and the employees were very nice and helpful. prices were excellent and we loved the salsas.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] You have to try their Super Nachos! Tortilla chips, re fried beans, delicious carne asada, cheese, pico de gallo, sour cream, and guacamole...what's not to love? (And if you don't like any of those things, just ask them to leave off an ingredient). Their Horchata is also some of the best I've ever tasted!\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] Pretty good Mexican food in a fast food drive through type place. The carne asada burrito was sublime.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] This is a very basic Mexican restaurant in one of the oldest strip malls in Goodyear. We have been going here for about 7 years now. It is one of those places one goes when one thinks about it. The food is almost always good, but has missed its mark a few times. In this miss it is usually because the food is just not warm enough. But this is not the norm. Working here one earns the money and it is done with a smile and efficiency. SO if you are ever in the neighborhood give them a try.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] Delicious! I am no expert in Mexican food, but I liked this place. there were only three pictures on yelp so I added some more. the food is reasonably priced. portions are good size. they use styrofoam plates and cups, but that's not a reason to take away a star. there's a nice hand painted mural on the wall.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] Carne asada taco salad is the best, horchata is always good and their salsas are really good. I also love their mini tacos and burritos.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] The window advertises xiao long bao (soup dumplings) for $2.99 for 8, for lunch, limit one per table. It's clearly a scheme to get you to come in. When we asked for it, they said it was $7.99. False advertising!\n",
      "\n",
      "This place had terrible service. The first time we asked for water, it never came. Then there was a waiter that stood around looking bored, and didn't see me frantically wave at him for several minutes. When they brought a big tub of soup, they didn't even give us bowls for the soup, and we had to ask for it separately.\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of all that, they put a gratuity charge on the check for a party of _three_. Last I checked, that was not normal except for large parties. I would have like the choice to give a 10% tip, given how bad the service was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the food was okay, but expensive. Not a pleasant experience, and the wait-staff was pretty bad. I would not recommend this place to anyone.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I probably would have given this place a 3 star for their AVERAGE food, except the service was REALLY BAD when I went. Just a tip for the guys @ New Shanghai, do not argue with your customers in front of other customers and expect to get a nice tip. Hey server guy, do not expect to vent to your customers about your stupid boss and expect my sympathy. No bueno.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place gives Chinese restaurants a bad name. SHAME ON YOU new shanghai! Never again!!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] ordered beef stew over rice. it was actually pretty tasty, although a bit salty. it was late in the afternoon so the service was actually pretty decent. just you're typical chinese reastaurant.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I was here for a Taiwanese breakfast and was very pleased with the Xiao Long Bao. It was not Din Tai Fung quality but for $2.95 it was a great value. The soup inside was delicious and the thickness of the skin and the taste of the meat were right on. (Be aware that only the first order of 8 is priced at $2.95. Additional orders are $6.95.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The soybean milk was soybean milk to me, I lacked the expertise to distinguish between excellent vs. average here. The chinese donut (yao tew) was not very crispy and somewhat hard. The scallion pancake was disappointing, it was hard and bland. I feel like giving a 4 star here due to the Xiao Long Bao, but the other items drag it down to a 3 star.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service was without a smile which is not surprising for chinese dive joints. Our waiter looked like he wished he was on a beach in Hawaii.\n",

      "We finished everything.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] We came here for lunch during a convention, and were pleasantly surprised to find decent Shanghainese food in LV.  Like Anthony W. said, the XLB was a pleasant surprise, especially for $2.95.  It was better than average, even by SGV standards.  \n",

      "Also tried a cold chicken dish with a ginger-soy dipping sauce, and a preserved vegetable/pork dish, both were very good.  \n",

      "This place was pretty good until recently. I think they had an ownership change. This review is for my visit on New Years weekend.\n",
      "Came at lunch time. There was 7 people dining in the restaurant including my party of 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything was ok until the waiter started messing up. This restaurant no longer speaks any English whatsoever. We tried speaking Cantonese but that didn't help either. We stuck to pointing to the menu. Thank goodness that helped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the food was ordered, the waiter was all over the place. We order cokes, which he just plopped the cans on the table. No ice or straws.\n",
      "We had to ask him for that. When the food came, we were stiffed on the soup that came with the meal. When we brought that up to the waiter, he rolled his eyes. When he brought the food over, he just basically dropped it on the table and walked away. The food proportions were stingy and everything was made just so sloppy.\n",
      "When it came to giving us the menus, they only gave us 2 for the 4 of us.\n",
      "It's not like the restaurant was full and short on menus.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food and service was so bad, we just paid for the food and left. We didn't even eat half of the food. If you're in this plaza, eat at the place next door. They used to be decent and run by a bunch of women who knew what they were doing but now it's run by people who have no clue of running a restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food was bad, the prices were high and service was not only non existent, it was horrible beyond belief!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Highly unrecommanded. Horrible service. We wish there is a 0 star.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Food is average, but many items are already gone when we arrived at 12:30pm, including soy milk. Asked for ginger, they say they don't have any; Chinese kitchen without ginger? I don't think so. \n",
      "Don't expect any service, not only us upset about it, customers at a neighboring table actually stood up and left after getting some attitute from waiter.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] This has to be one of the worst restaurant in Vegas! Please do yourself a favor, avoid this restaurant unless you willing to get ripoff.\n",
      "First, they advertised on Xiao Lung Bao for $2.95 and we got charged for $6.95. I confronted the waiter, He said he already gave me $2 off. It was supposed to be $8.95.\n",
      "Second, for two of us ate there, they added 15% tips on your bill. I don't mind to pay 15% tips but their service and most of the food that we ordered sucks! The pot of tea they gave us  taste like something I cannot describe. Waiters are extremely pushy and rude! We ordered lamb soup, it has about 6-7 really thin slices of lamb in it. That' it! The wrapping on the Xiao Lung Bao was thick. Taste like its from a frozen package. Scallion pancake was OK. though. \n",
      "Third, they gave me the wrong change. I have to ask to get my money back.\n",
      "One dinning experience got ripped off three times. How can you beat it?\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] My family and I think this place is great.  I think it has changed owner.  We have been here at least 15 times. We love the spicy chicken the BBQ pork and the tofu noodles with salted pork.  If you have never had real Chinese food you may not like this place.  We have never had a problem with the service and rarely ordered a dish we did not like.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Facts:\n",
      "Understaffed\n",

      "Lady at cashier yelled at our server for his poor service, as we happily made our way out and took our business elsewhere.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] This place is an absolute relief for me and the family since we were tired of all of the buffets and fried food.  We came here a few times and their portions and prices are great.  Situated in a Ranch 99 shopping mall (on the 2nd floor), they have great service and are extremely friendly.  Their Shanghai Thick Fried Noodles are really good and if you can still get Soybean milk (served during breakfast), you have to try it\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been here for lunch and they get absolutely slammed.  It's really quiet during the dinner hours so it might be best to go then.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I've been here a couple of times with my dad for dinner. This place serves pretty good dish. I didn't quite like the fried pork dish. I can never tell if I'm eating fat or meat. Other dishes aren't bad.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] came here for a late breakfast/early lunch and the restaurant was practically empty...think there was one other table.\n",
      "\n",
      "we started off with the housemade warm soybean milk...a perfect way to start a very cold and windy day.  we ordered 2 bowls, but i think 1 would have been plenty for two people\n",
      "\n",
      "others dishes we ordered:\n",
      "shanghai style wonton:  pork wonton in chicken stock seasoned with preserved/salted baby shrimp and garnished with shredded seaweed.  yummy\n",
      "\n",
      "jellyfish salad:  a cold savory dish.  was expecting a sweet/sour flavor combination...but was good nonetheless...a little more acid would have made it perfect\n",
      "\n",
      "beefstew with noodles and spinach:  good, but not enough beef\n",
      "\n",
      "scallion pancake:  i've had better...least favorite dish. \n",
      "\n",
      "xiao long bao:   the most anticipated dish...the flavor was good, but it wasn't juicy enough...also did not come with the typical vinegar sauce with the slivers of ginger...would have asked for it, but our waiter did not speak any english =(\n",
      "\n",
      "i would definitely come here again...the portions are somewhat smallish, but they are very reasonably priced.  suggest coming here with a big group so you can try a lot more dishes...\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] I walked by and saw Juicy Steamed Dumplings for $2.95. I was like count me in because we don't ever have them for that cheap in the OC.  I ended up making my final lunch stop at the New Shanghai Restaurant and I would say I stayed full. There were 8 pieces of steamed dumplings, and I ate 4 at the restaurant and they were still good by the time I got all the way back home in the OC. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also ordered an entree of Kung Pao chicken. I would say the chicken was mediocre and lacked flavor. They need to emphasize on improving their entrees from some of the other reviews. However if you want dumplings, this is the place to go for cheap. \n",
      "\n",
      "One last reason why I had to take an extra star off was because they do not accept credit cards for transactions under a certain amount. I just think they want to pocket the cash and keep things on the D.L if you know what I mean. Either ways, it was still good in my books.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Out of ALL the Asian restaurants that line the Spring Mountain Road strip of Vegas' Chinatown, whyyyyy did we have to choose this one??\n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant was a ghost town on a Saturday night.  We were the only ones in the restaurant for the first half of our meal.  While we ate, the employees were either collaborating with the cleaning of the fish tank or kept pacing around our table.  Can you say, awkward and uncomfortable?!\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Shanghai fried noodles: these noodles would put Shanghainese people to shame.  It was more like an Americanized chow mein.  The noodles weren't the authentic thick and round kind, and the taste was a far cry from what I'm accustomed to.  Gross. \n",
      " \n",
      "* Xiaolong bao: the XLB were decent but you could detect the thawed taste in the meat filling--obviously frozen, not fresh.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Fish fillets in wine and vinegar sauce: mediocre dish, but the wine and vinegar ratio was very imbalanced.  It was more vinegary than drunken.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Wheat gluten (mian jin) and mushroom dish for our veggie friend: the mian jin was funky--way too spongy and slimy inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "What finally broke the camel's back for us was the service.  Keep in mind it was just us and another couple dining here.  Also keep in mind that we were here around 9pm and the restaurant has a huge neon Chinese sign on the outside that says \"late night meals.\"  So they were obviously not closing anytime soon.  But midway during our meal, one of the male servers comes over and tells us to take the last XLB from the steamer.  We tell him, \"we'll get to it later, please keep it here.\"  As if he didn't understand our Mandarin, he continued ushering us to take the last XLB.  So we continued telling him to leave it alone.  But he wouldn't budge.  So for the sake of not causing a scene, we gave in and just took the darn thing.  It was annoying and rude.  What was the darn rush?  Soon after that incident, he just kept hovering and pacing around our table.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that's why we gave them less than 10% tip...\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Very good food.  Surprised actually, being from LA.  The dumplings seem to be fresh- both the steamed and fried.  The shanghai chow mein is very good.  Prices are very reasonable.  Would recommend to anyone who craves niche shanghai style food in LV.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Well, one word i want to say \"sucks\"~ four of us went to this restaurant because the next door was too crowed~ we found out the decision was so wrong~ \n",
      "\n",
      "first, they did not have any breakfast to order which did not match with their Ads outside. after we sat down, we waited more than half an hour for all dishes but in the end, they just cancel our order and let us go becayse there are more people waiting outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, the food was very little, just one spoon per person and no one was full~ \n",
      "\n",
      " i think this restaurant is not even qualified for one star~ \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, think carefully before you go and this restaurant is not recommend at all!!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] If I could give negative stars I would. This was one of the worst and most disgusting culinary experiences I've ever had. \n",
      "\n",
      "We got there for breakfast, and we ordered a large range of items including the dou jiang (soy milk), you tiao, shanghai chow mein, xiaolongbao, etc. The waitress told us to order the Drunken Chicken which she said was particularly good, so we gave in and ordered it as per her suggestion. \n",
      "\n",
      "Everything was absolutely disgusting. The drunken chicken was stale and obviously bad, it was completely unedible. The only reason why she kept pushing it was because they didn't want to throw it away. \n",
      "\n",
      "The porridge was clumpy and tasteless. I could make better porridge at home, it definitely was not fresh. \n",
      "\n",
      "Worst of all, when we poured sugar into the soy milk, there was a DEAD FLY IN THE SUGAR!! She took back the bowl, and we told her to make sure to give us a new bowl. She said yeah, but it came back out steaming hot, much hotter than when she first brought out the soy milk. Which made us think that they microwaved that same bowl!\n",
      "\n",
      "The xiaolongbao was the only edible thing but it was obviously from a frozen package purchased next door. \n",
      "\n",
      "When we got our bill, I asked her to take the drunken chicken off because it was inedible, stale and not fresh at all. Plus, she had been the one who recommended it. They insisted that that's the way it was supposed to be made and refused to take it off the bill. They were obviously hustling us, did not give a damn about the quality of the food and were only about taking our money. \n",
      "\n",
      "STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] Planned to go to one of the buffets in the hotels but realized it was too late for the ones we wanted instead we headed down to 'Chinatown' and hit up Shanghai Restaurant for dinner. We ordered five dishes, and everything was perfect. The basil frog was excellent, very clean taste and great cooking. :) But I only ordered it jokingly and thought she didn't actually write it down. Oh boy she did. Their Shanghai Fish dish was killer, by the end of dinner i was ready to die :)\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] OMG! This made our black list right away. Terrible service and food is just awful. Eeek! The green onion pancake is so doughy and badly needed salt. The \"jia zhurng' noodles looked like spaghetti noodles mixed with something scraped up from the gutter. Don't even spend your money at this restaurant. There were lots of unhappy customers when we were there. \n",
      "\n",
      "We went to China Mama the other day and it was much better!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] We could not believe there was a Shanghainese restaurant in Vegas. We were just driving around and I noticed in huge Chinese writing for xiao long bao $3.95. Hubby said \"let's go eat there\". I'm like \"right now?\" He's like \"yeah\". It was 4pm and it was neither here nor there, but I complied.\n",
      "\n",
      "We get in there and the Shanghainese owner seated us. He was pretty funny. After finding out I could speak the language, he came over and talked and talked with us. \n",
      "\n",
      "We got the XLB since it was so cheap hoping it would be good. They also had 'ma lan tou' which is a cold appetizer (which I love). We also ordered scallion pancakes which is lil guy's favorite. Stir fried rice cake is also another favorite of our's so we got an order of that too.  I then noticed they also had salty soy bean milk which, generally is on the weekend menu of many restaurants but here, you can get it at any time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rice cakes was delicious, so was the ma lan tou. Lil guy loved the scallion pancakes AND the rice cakes. Hubby loved the salty soy milk. I thought the soy milk was really good.... again so surprising in Las Vegas of all places. The only thing which was not up to par to Din Tai Fung of course as the wrapper was on the thick side, but for $3.95, it was alright.\n",
      "\n",
      "To find such good Shanghainese food is one thing in the LA area, but in Vegas? I was pretty blown away. The owner was tickled pink watching hubby eat all the traditional foods commenting on it whenever he could. Since the restaurant was empty at 4pm, he was hovering over us pretty much the entire time we were eating. So funny!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] The Food and Service was HORRIBLE. The pepole sitting next to us found HAIR IN THEIR FOOD and we saw a cockroach on one of the tables! One of their dishes tasted so NASTY and SALTY. \n",
      "When i asked them to take away the dish, they laughed at me. \n",
      "I only tasted it and they still forced me to pay. \n",
      "I was outraged! Then they made a huge scene embarrassing me stating that I had bad taste! \n",
      "Can you believe that? \n",
      "Not only that... for 3 people, they expected us to pay 70 bux! to take their crap?? NO THANK YOU!\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] The only reason I'm not giving this place a 1-star is that I'm saving it for its neighbor-restaurant upstairs in the same plaza, with the atrociously rude waiters. But that's a tale for another review.\n",
      "\n",
      "My parents and I came into this place because we were so frustrated after trying to get a table at the other place, and indeed we were seated pretty quickly. This was the second time my parents have been there, the first for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "There were a decent amount of people there... I'd say the restaurant was at about 70% capacity. And there were no shortage of waiters and waitresses, but somehow everyone who served us seemed flustered, like they didn't know how to cope with so much business! (This was on maybe the 28th of December, so probably pre-New Year's influx of tourists)\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the menu frustrated me. I'm a vegetarian, so when I saw \"Vegetable soup wonton\" in english (\"Ji cai won ton\" is what it said in chinese), I figured it'd be a safe bet. Except that when my wonton soup arrived it was like 90% meat and 10% vegetable filling. I ended up drinking the soup around the wontons and eating the wonton skins. I'm sure it would have been delicious if only I could have EATEN IT. :(\n",
      "\n",
      "They were out of a bunch of stuff, just seemed really disorganized in general, and to make things worse, what my dad ordered, shao bing (the flaky pastry) you tiao (fried dough stick/chinese doughnut)and xian dou jiang (salty soymilk, literally translated) were really really subpar. The shao bing wasn't precut, the you tiao was UNDERCOOKED, and the xian dou jiang had no flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, a very sad meal, especially since it was really expensive for the amounts of food we got (not even going to talk about how expensive it was for the amount of food we ATE).\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're in Vegas on vacation and trying to avoid the buffet-traps of the strip without breaking the bank, DON'T COME HERE. I don't know about the other restaurants in Chinatown, but this one is just not worth your time.\n",
      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] this restaurant is actually pretty good for the buck. i didn't expect it to be good at all. as soon as i sat down inside, i took my phone out and started to yelp the name. @ first i was like, **** this is going to be a wasted night. after eatting couple dishes, i wasn't disappointed. \n",

      "Chinese ['Restaurants', 'Chinese'] We decided to stop by here before leaving our long 4th of July weekend...BIG MISTAKE!  There were 2 lady servers and 1 man, all were very disorganized and MEAN!   The servers would not stop yelling and arguing amongst themselves, and the yelling would continue throughout the whole restaurant.  The servers argued in a loud yelling manner to one customer that received an incorrect order, the customer yelled right back  which started a crazy yelling match, 2 lady servers vs. a lady customer!  \n",
      "\n",
      "There was no follow-up service, and the wicked servers (which I believed own the place) would rather have you not in there!!!  During our meal there were multiple customers that walked out on them, GOOD CHOICE, WISH WE WOULD'VE WALKED OUT BEFORE WE HAD A CHANCE!!!    I've never seen servers so relieved to see customers walk away--Out the Door!\n",
      "\n",
      "And like some of the other reviewers said, they try to sell you appetizers and just bring them out to you;  forcing you to eat them!!  If you order and refuse an item you are destined for a BIG Argument!\n",
      "\n",
      "I can stand poor/bad service sometimes, but when I go to a restaurant I expect to at least not, get yelled at very loudly (indeed it happened to us once when we got napkins off another table because there was NO Service), see other patrons having yelling matches with the servers, see employees yelling at eachother constantly, and fighting to pay your bill and being told to wait (at least 30 mins.)!\n",

      "NEVER EVER GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Asian Fusion', 'Desserts', 'Cafes', 'Restaurants', 'Coffee & Tea', 'Food'] This place is very nice and colorful. The service was great. I also like their hand made menu! its very cute! When I go there, I often order a black milk tea wich is veryyyyyy goood by the way. The dumplings are good too. This is a nice place to meet friend for a coffee .\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I was back in town for a week and I heard about this place having real NYC style pizza. I expected it to be typical mediocre pizza but it was really really good.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't compare it to pizza you might find in New York but compared to pizza you find around here, it is excellent. The crust is thin, the pizza is gigantic and it is basic and memorable. We got an 18 inch cheese and an 18 inch pepperoni and the cheese was better. This kind of pizza doesn't support mountains of toppings and the pepperoni pizza seemed overpowered. The cheese pizza was amazing and a reasonable person could eat much more pizza than usual since the crust is so thin. Get more than you think you'll want.\n",
      "\n",
      "The people running the place are really nice and seem thankful that you're giving them a try. They have a chipotle knockoff tacqueria there too but I can't say if it is good. Based on their efforts with the pizza, I'd give it a try.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another plus; an 18 inch cheese pizza costs ten bucks. In Chicago, they'd want at least twenty and it wouldn't be this good. If you're sick of boring mediocre pizza, try this place.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I ordered delivery here for the first time Sunday. The guy who answered the phone was very rude, and when I asked him what kind of cheese was in the Stromboli he dismissed my question and asked me for my address. I gave him my address and he asked me very rudely what my question was again. He advised that it was mozzarella and I decided to order it. That's what came on the Stromboli, just cheese. I reviewed the menu again and it said it came with three toppings, most Strombolis are standard, so i didn't know I had to choose. The gentleman who took the call never told me so what I ended up with was cheese bread. I also ordered a Italian sub cold, and while it was served cold it barely had any meat at all on it. It was all bread and cheese. It's safe to say I will not be ordering again.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] There was nothing special about this pizza.  It was plain and mediocre... I would not pay $15 again for  a large 2 topping... just not worth it\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] This is the real deal for Naw Yawk  style pizza in the Cleveburgh area.... A+ from the crust to the sauce to the cheese. Others have tried....but Anselmo's has succeeded.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] OK, now I KNOW this review is going to be considered blasphemous by many, and that's fine. \n",

      "Now, I'm not entirely ready to declare a new favorite, but after my first meatball sub from Anselmo's yesterday, I'm awfully damn close. But I'm just going to have to try another one (or 12) and then we'll see. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless, Anselmo's sub is worthy of great praise. It's amazing to me how everything here is made with such high quality ingredients and care. It's obvious Anselmo's works hard to deliver not just good food, but great food.  Major props to Anselmo's!\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I tried Anselmo's for the first time today because I was craving a grinder. I was already concerned when I opened my order at home and the paper sandwich bag was ripping apart! It was so saturated with dressing the bag literally disintegrated. I think the bread and meats were decent, but who could tell under all that oil? It felt like I was being punished for ordering at the end of the night. Next time do your customer a favor and tell them \"Kitchen's closed\" instead of serving a resentwich.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Just ordered delivery based on the reviews here. It was the best pizza ever!!! SO good!!!!! I seriously can't wait to order it again :)\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I am so, so happy to update this review!  Just a few days after I posted my last review I got a message from the owner, Chris.  He was generous and offered a credit if I called back.  Tonight we ordered the meatball and Italian grinders and the fried pickle chips because I *LOVE* fried pickles.  Yum-oh!  There was a sweet girl on the phone who was very attentive with taking my order.  I was quoted 45 minutes to an hour but it arrived after an hour and 5 minutes.  The fried pickle chips came with a side of ranch and were crispy, not soggy.  So tasty!  Their grinders are huge!  I could only eat half of the Italian one but I'm looking forward to the other half for lunch tomorrow.  I tried a bite of the meatball sub which was also quite yummy.  Check this place out!\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] If you like NY style pizza in Cleveland this is the place to go. Chris the owner who stretches and pulls the dough right in front of you is very engaging to talk to. He twirls that dough  around his hands and sends it spinning in the air!  Definitely better than those franchise places that seem to pollute every strip mall across town. If you like independent mom& pop establishments you will not be disappointed. I love NY style pizza and this was the closest that I could find and the prices are great!\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I went back today!! (Yes, that was me ordering the slices and soup) I am happy to say that I believe Anselmo's has nailed it just about as close as we will probably find in Cleveland..as I'm told the difference in the crust is in the water in NY which I guess there is nothing we can do about! \n",
      "I had a couple of slices that had been in the case for about a half an hour..and they were good, so I'm assuming when I order it fresh..which for it be like home would be with extra sauce, cheese and oil! lol then I have a feeling that minus the crust issue, this is going to be the most authentic NY style pizza anyone will find here! So congratulations! I'm excited for my kids to try this again. They are very picky having grown up in NY/NJ.\n",
      "I also had the Chicken noodle soup, which was very tasty..a tad salty, but overall, very good!\n",
      "Now, like I said, when you start making those Jersey Subs I told you about please holla! lol\n",
      "Fast Food ['Restaurants', 'Chinese', 'Fast Food'] This is located in the local area mall.  Only had a few people in front of me in line and it was moving incredibily slow.  Overall food was good.  How could you go wrong with Orange Chicken?\n",
      "Fast Food ['Restaurants', 'Chinese', 'Fast Food'] What can you say about Panda Express Fast Food?----It's fast and that's it.

      "Coffee & Tea ['Juice Bars & Smoothies', 'Restaurants', 'Desserts', 'Food', 'Cafes', 'Coffee & Tea'] I love juice. I love vegan sandwiches. And despite being a crazy cat lady, I like small dogs who hang out in cafes. Daily Press has all of these things. \n",
      "\n",
      "My fiance and I stopped in for some lunch on a Saturday afternoon and enjoyed some juice and grub while getting sad eyes from the little doggie (Miles, I think?) who wanted some of our lunch. I had a green juice that was solid and we split some chili. The chili was good but the sour cream on top was amazing. Almost too real tasting to be vegan. I had the tofu bahn mi which was also solid, but I had a bite of my fiance's Italian grilled cheese and it was amazing. (so amazing that I have since recreated the sandwich at home because I liked it THAT much) Our sandwiches were served with a side of sliced avocado. I wish I could get a side of avocado everywhere, honestly. Yum!\n",

      "Hope to come in soon.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Juice Bars & Smoothies', 'Restaurants', 'Desserts', 'Food', 'Cafes', 'Coffee & Tea'] I have tried a few juices and none have disappointed. The girl who runs the place knows her juices. I had some with cilantro to get this metal out of me. I think it worked. The beet juice turned my urine pink which was alarming yet fun. I may try to make my own juice of beet and asparagus to get a stinky pink concoction of waste. Or recommend it to this place. The dog that hangs out here is adorable and a good replacement for Todd the Cat that used to hang at Hausfrau.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Juice Bars & Smoothies', 'Restaurants', 'Desserts', 'Food', 'Cafes', 'Coffee & Tea'] I've been dying to try this place and stopped in for a Saturday late breakfast. The shop is small but super cute. Comfy chairs and colorful decor. We ordered the strawberries and cream smoothie bowl, and the peanutbutter chocolate smoothie bowl. Both were so delicious!! You can order smoothies or smoothie bowls, where they add grains, granola and fruit. They make all their smoothies with a made in house nut milk that made them nice and creamy. \n",

      "While we were eating, a mom and daughter walked in for some drinks to take out, and the mom was telling the associates how much she loves their juice cleanses, and is going to do one every month!

      "Coffee & Tea ['Juice Bars & Smoothies', 'Restaurants', 'Desserts', 'Food', 'Cafes', 'Coffee & Tea'] This place is adorable and very brave to open right before this winter season!!! I went on Saturday afternoon to meet a friend to try out the newest addition to the Gordon Square area. Promptly I was greeted by the sweet Milo. After looking through the menu and chatting with the owner, we decided I should try the Beauty Revival Smoothie with an addition of greens (kale and spinach). So delicious. When my friend arrived, she ordered the same and also the Italian Grilled Cheese. It came piping hot with a side salad. After trying a couple bites, I knew I would come back to get my own. The Banh Mi also sounds amazing and can come toasted. There is a side fridge where you can grab and go or stay with your daily pressed juice. If you bring back the bottle, you will get $1 off your next order. They also carry other items from Red Lotus Foods and the Bearded Bunch among others.\n",

      "Coffee & Tea ['Juice Bars & Smoothies', 'Restaurants', 'Desserts', 'Food', 'Cafes', 'Coffee & Tea'] Came here with my wife and daughter. It was off the hook. Like, this place just became our new go-to for food. I'm not even a vegan and I loved it. The space is incredible: clean,  bright, minimal, and airy. The woman who owns the place was great (and apparently not phased by toddler mayhem).\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the vegan \"egg\" salad sandwich. Talk about flavor! The salted avocado on the side was a great touch. 10/10 would eat again. My wife had the chili and she thought it was great (and she's super picky, like frustrating to dine out with picky). We split a grapefruit, orange, pineapple, and cayenne juice. Once again, Daily Press delivered. \n",

      "Coffee & Tea ['Juice Bars & Smoothies', 'Restaurants', 'Desserts', 'Food', 'Cafes', 'Coffee & Tea'] How did this juice bar hook me?

      "This place is my new everything. When you walk through the door, Jodi's \"vicious\" attack dog Miles (a small Chihuahua) will promptly greet you and assess his ability to get food from you.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The ambient, minimalistic feel of this juicery takes the cake. In very Andy Warhol-like fashion, there's a wire hanger wall of polaroids. Jodi keeps a polaroid camera, and customers can snap photos to hang. Most of the photos are faded from all the natural light that pours through the windows, but it's awesome nonetheless. \n",
      "\n",
      "Daily Press radiates this fantastic, community feel. I love that everyone in there always seems to know each other. As for juice, the \"Its Electric\" (cucumber, lemon, ginger, green apple, pineapple) might be my favorite green juice that I've ever ordered at any juicery, ever. It has a tart flavor but isn't overwhelming. In my eyes, this place can truly do no wrong. Stop in and see for yourself! Oh, and bring your glass bottle back for $1 off your next juice!\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] This is the newest one in town, close to work so we gave it a try. My pizza came in a timely manner. It was my favorite, smoking buffalo chicken. HOWEVER, my pregnant coworker, who ordered before me, had to wait for hers....evidently it was just sitting there waiting to be delivered. Pizza was good though.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Been here a few times, pizza has been great other times but today was just terrible. It was NOT busy at all when I ordered so no reason why my order was burnt. I will give it another try another day and update my review.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Shorthanded or this the way they operate?  Only 3 people working, alternating between cashiering, making pizza, cleaning tables, etc.  If Pieology is a franchise, then whoever owns this one needs to go look at Downtown Summerlin to see how a good place is run.  In a nutshell:  Rustic Veggie Pizza on menu supposed to be whole wheat crust, this place claims they no longer carry it.  Strike 1. BBQ chicken pizza without BBQ sauce? Was told it would be on the pizza, they bring it, and it's not.  I ask where is the sauce, they say you didn't ask for it!  BBQ chicken pizza with no BBQ on it.  Strike two.  Bathrooms filthy and men's room door does not lock.  Strike 3.  You're out.  And the pizza here was not that good.  Go to Downtown Summerlin, it's a thousand times better there, and they know what they are doing.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] To be honest it's nothing better than to be able to order and eat good food in less than 10 minutes. You can say I'm something like a fast food junkie...but don't think for a second that your typical fast food places compare to Pieolgy! Although it's fast it is so fresh! One of my daughters favorite food is pizza, mine is salad and we can get both just the way we like!!! It's ridiculous how inexpensive yet filling our personal dishes are...i love it! Check out my photos and see just how amazing the food looks..it tastes even better!!\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] For now, open just over a month, this place is still working out the kinks. On a busy Saturday night, all four of our pizzas were way undercooked. They looked OK and the toppings were good, but the crust was soggy and chewy. Also, they don't have their liquor license yet.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] First I wanted to come try because it is a new business and I'm a new business owner and I know how the owner must have feel. I'm not disappoint! I love Blaze Pizza but k have to say this place is better in my opinion. I love their dough better.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Same concept as Blaze Pizza on Decatur. Great array of toppings. Crust is good although tends to be doughy in the middle. Good salad choices including make your own. Overall very good. Definitely recommend.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I wish I could give more stars but honestly I was super sad to discover this pizza doesn't match up to its competitors .. the price point is pretty high especially since I am used to being able to get single topping pizza options from my preferred build your own pizza place ... the sauce is not really flavorful and frankly the pizza was so hard and burnt that my tongue still is cut up..\n",
      "\n",
      "The staff was great and everyone was friendly which is why I am going with two stars .. Usually I wait a few visits before doing a review but I just don't see myself going back here ..\n",

      "If you do plan a trip make sure to sign up with their e club to get a free treat\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Perfect for this area we needed something new. Fresh ingredients, courteous staff, great prices.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I've come here before and multiple locations and had no problems. Everyone today had there pizzas burnt or getting the wrong ones.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I was so excited when I saw a Pieology opened in Vegas, I first tried it in California and just always love their pizza, this one didn't disappoint me and I also brought my boyfriend and his daughter here, for the first time I see his daughter finished the whole thing, I guess they weren't disappointed as a first timer either lol\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Tried this new pizza spot, and it was so good. I called before to make sure there wasn't any egg/dairy in the pizza dough, because I am vegan. I did get hung up on the first time I called, but the 2nd time they told me the ingredients are just flour and water. It is a thin crust , so that makes sense. It's a chipotle / subway style place, and you add whatever you want to it. The great thing is they don't charge extra for toppings. All together they are pretty reasonably priced. It was so busy when I got there, and I still got my pizza in a timely fashion. All employees were pretty nice. I gave them 4 stars because they were out of spinach. I love spinach on my pizza, so I was a little disappointed. I also didn't enjoy getting hung up on after being on hold for awhile, but they were busy so it is what it is. Overall very satisfied and will be recommending to friends and family.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] The best build your own pizza I've had ever. The red sauce & herb butter tasted great. The toppings looked & tasted fresh. Great value for what I paid. We'll definitely go back again!\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I wish I could give them zero stars, but since I can't, here it goes. My husband and I went on to order food and there was no line. We walked up and were taking about their pizza crust because it was sitting out and looked crusty. My husband started his order and they grabbed the crusty dough and when he asked for fresh dough they gave him an attitude about it. He shrugged it off thinking it was just more work. Then when they put the sauce on, it was only on one side and he asked them four times (over the extremely loud music) to spread it out but they refused saying it was fine. \n",
      "Well, that was it for us, we had enough from them and left. I have no idea how their food tastes, but if you want a good pizza that you can build your way, go to Blaze instead...and they have great lemonade too.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Who doesn't want a custom made pizza ready in about 150 seconds! First timer here. I can get any topping I mean any just for $7.99 add $2 if you want a gluten free crust. Fast and convenient walkthrough when you order. Simple and easy menu to navigate. They also have salads for more carb free diet. Can't wait to bring friends and family for some socializing. Lovely staff. Can't get enough of the aromas, the oven, and the people who enjoy their pies.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I LOVE Pieology!!!! Went for lunch with my co-workers. Wasn't too crowded unlike other restaurants in that shopping center. Having the ability to create your own is amazing! The staff was going above and beyond with their attentive customer service. Especially, a guy named Z. Great staff, great food, great location! You can't beat it. Your pizza woes are solved, it's easy as Pie-ology!!!\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Pizza here was good, service was good but making the pizza was a little messy. The sauce and and toppings falling all over the place touching each other, so if your allergic to mushrooms they might fall into the bell peppers you might be out of luck trying to get certain toppings kept out of your pizza. I would still recommend this place for a quick fresh pizza for dinner!\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Love the pizza, and the customer service is outstanding. They treat every customer like its their first time there. I even ordered my pies to go stepped outside to my car, and the gentleman who made my pie brought it to my car.... Customer service at it's finest, please don't change...\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I was actually about to go to Chipotle next door and forgot they were still building last I remembered. This is so cool! For what you can get & the options they have for the price you pay is just too good. I think what really made me write this review is the service. It's just a casual pizza place but EVERYONE was so nice & friendly. All guys that worked were super polite & all of them were smiling. There was a certain guy that was very pleasant, I wish I got his name but he had facial hair, that's all I remember! He stood out the most to me because he was friendly to everyone, he seemed to be expediting in all areas & I loved his sense of urgency because the place was busy. Can't wait to go back :)\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Dear North Las Vegans:\n",

      "How in the world did you get a Pieology?! I am jealous, and you are spoiled!\n",
      "\n",
      "If you've never had it - think Chipotle style dining, but with pizza.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I heard this new location had opened, I had to check it out for myself. From the moment I arrived at the plaza, I was in awe. This location is gorgeous, inside and out! I love the trendy industrial style that blends well with the luxurious touches and pops of color.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was greeted immediately upon entry by a full staff with friendly faces. I could tell they all had 'The Mark of Jake'; Jake is the District Manager who I met at the Eastside shop. If I ever had an issue with anything (which was like... twice in one hundred visits), he not only fixed it with me, but also fixed it in the store. His staff members are always polite, friendly and on point, and this shop in NLV is no exception. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, when I got up to the line, I found that it was more beautiful than usual. The setup is almost exactly the same as I was used to - but I will say - they added SHAVED PARMESAN at the end (NOM).\n",
      "\n",
      "My Pieology Equation(TM) - aka my custom pie - is called The O'Hara. \n",
      "\n",
      "It starts with a thin wheat crust with butter and olive oil. I skip the sauce base and instead add a little sauce on top of the cheese. All five of the cheeses are a go for me - that's Mozzarella, Parmesan, light Feta, extra Gorgonzola, and 5 small scoops of Ricotta. Yeah, it's that serious. Then I add a few swirls of Alfredo before the veggies. I start with a little extra of both basil and cilantro, a few pieces of spinach (which are now chopped up - hooray!), and some garlic. My favorite meat toppings are pepperoni and spicy chicken. And as I mentioned, there are some new additions at the end of the line (perhaps it is also for people to create salads?), so I added fresh black pepper and shaved Parmesan. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I get the same pizza every time. I'm a creature of habit. But what I think I love most about Pieology is that no matter what I get, I pay the same price. (They have a Gluten Free crust for a couple bucks more - but I'm talking toppings here, people). \n",
      "\n",
      "I paid my $8.64 (including tax) and within 5 minutes time I was taking a bite of one of the most delicious pizzas I've had in forever. The guy who delivered it asked me if I needed anything, like dipping sauces or toppings, and he checked back with me about halfway through my meal. It's like fancy-fast-fare. \n",
      "\n",
      "Whether you are on your lunch break or headed to see a movie across the street, I highly recommend you check this place out. Two people can grab two fresh custom pies and a drink for around $20. In less than 10 minutes. That is unreal. Date night will never be the same. \n",
      "\n",
      "Nom.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I must say, I liked the pizza but the atmosphere was horrible. I sat in for a late lunch with my sister and the music was very loud. We could barely hear each other. I would not take children in there because most of the music had curse words and used the N word a lot. I will not go back to this place. I would have given it a one star but like I said I liked the pizza.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Man let me just say A W E S O M E!! Great pricing and amazing pizza! Exactly how you want to have a pizza and unlimited  .  Will be returning very soon!\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] The pizza is deff worth the money, I love that there is alot of flavor because of the butter based sauce they put on . And you can put ranch on top at the end as well. Would definitely go again for a lunch type of thing .\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Really great variety of toppings. I had to get the gluten free crust because their traditional crusts are not vegan. It wasn't my favorite but the toppings & daiya cheese made up for it. Also, the customer service is excellent.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I just want to preface my review as an honest reviewer, not just in it for the freebies with a 5 star review. I'm really happy they opened this location since I work right down the street and the north side is always in need of new restaurant options. The line tends to get a bit long at lunch time, but it goes by quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most recent time I came with some coworkers I had a create your own salad. The overall quality and size was good of the salad was good. I just wish they had a bit more salad options like different meats, more veggies or noodles. The pizzas have been good in the past, but this most recent visit both of my coworkers' pizzas turned out overly soggy and wet.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would come back again, but I really wish they wouldn't encourage false positive reviews. Just let  your food and service speak for itself.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] So three stars between my husband and I. My husband really liked this place, I on the other hand didn't. That's why I decided to split the difference to be fair. For me it wasn't what I was expecting/hoping for. Granted we stopped by the first week following their opening and I'm sure they were just getting used to it. The pie choices are limited (compared to other similar places I've been to) and the flavor did not impress me. Would I be back? Meh...\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] It's worth the $8 they charge for it.  I'd say it's the next step up from a $6 frozen pizza.  It's kind of fun that they make it right it front of you, but don't expect greatness for $8.  The location is new and clean.  As they said in Boogie Nights, \"it is what it is.\"  HAHA\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] so wanted to try an alternative to blaze. not stoked.  first they started making the completely wrong pizza. whatever, not a big deal. so then the server was supposed to bring my side sauce, but they never came back so i got it myself.  also not that big of a deal \n",
      "\n",
      "what is a big deal is their pizza was so nasty it tasted like a cheap frozen pizza that you can get for a dollar similar to totino's pizza.  the cheese was so cheap and processed it hardens shortly after it starts to cool..  \n",
      "\n",
      "after a few bites you just start to feel icky from the super low grade ingredients.  I would not eat here again, if you do want this style food, i would recommend going to blaze off Decatur, which is worth the wait\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Pretty good pizza for a quick bite. Same concept as Chipotle, Subway or Cafe Rio. Choose what you'd like, they make it in front of you and then cook it quickly. \n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered a Caesar salad and a chicken BBQ pizza. The crust was thin and crunchy with a little char you come to know and love like your local pizzeria, the BBQ sauce was flavorful and sweet and we received it all in a timely manner. I wouldn't recommend ordering from this place for take out. I think their food is better eaten on site. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was a bargain for less than $20. I think one pizza and a salad for two people was just the right amount of food.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I stopped by for lunch and like my experience at a previous Pieology location I wasn't impressed. When I walked in they were very busy and I waited in line about 10 minutes to place my order and about another 10 minutes to receive my pizza. I've dealt with this type of wait at Blaze Pizza however the employees are friendly at Blaze and don't hurry you through the line like here at Pieology. I wanted ricotta on my pizza, but after seeing it I changed my mind. The ricotta looked not fresh like it had been there a long time and there was tons of other pizza toppings on top of the ricotta. I know it gets busy and when grabbing different toppings while making a pizza they sometimes drop stuff in different areas, but it needs to be controlled and cleaned! I also noticed the lack of toppings offered compared to Blaze and wished they had more options for cheese like the ovalini mozzarella that Blaze has. I only saw one option for pizza crust while Blaze offers a high-rise crust option. Yes I am comparing the two pizza places a lot because they are trying to accomplish the same type of fast casual pizza experience yet both have differences. \n",
      "\n",
      "Custom Pie ($7.99) - The custom pie allows you to be creative and top your pizza to your liking all for one price. I chose shredded mozzarella, mushroom, pepperoni and pineapple. I only ate half of my pizza before trashing it because it had such a weird taste, mostly burnt. The toppings were completely uneven, the pepperoni was mostly all in the center of the pizza. The crust was so burnt especially around the edges. I don't get the hype for this place. At all. What they call pizza here is nothing more than a extra burnt thin cracker with cheese and toppings. Seriously, just take a saltine cracker, torch the sides and bottom, melt cheese on it and you'll have a Pieology pizza. I'll stick with Blaze Pizza on Decatur.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Finally tried the new pieology! Very clean, sleek atmosphere with great service. \n",
      "I was a little overwhelmed , so I chose the BBQ chicken from the \"favorite\" section. Less than 5 minutes, my pie was ready piping hot in a easy to carry box. \n",
      "The pie was delicious! Great cheese and chicken flavor. This is almost too much for 1 person! \n",
      "I will def. be back to make my own creation. Wonderful and great addition to the neighborhood.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] This is my first time having Pieology off the strip. My pizza was a bit over cooked. I had the thicker crust, I now prefer the original one. I had all of the meats with the exception of chicken with basil, onions, banana peppers, cilantro....Next time I won't get the basil nor cilantro, not that it was bad, just not the taste I was going for. Can't beat a personal made pizza for 7.99. Will return...\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Checked in to this neighborhood pizza joint this evening and ordered the Alfredo Alfredo pizza. The concept is pretty cool, the restaurant is clean and most importantly the food was prepared fast and taste pretty good...\n",
      "\n",
      "$7.99x2 well spent\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] This is something that came to this neighborhood that made me so happy I couldn't wait for opening day. Well here it is, my first visit to my local Pieology. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was very happy with the help in building exactly what I wanted. Everything tastes as I had hoped and I'll be back for sure.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] The taste was okay, they messed up on my wife's pizza, I went about two weeks after they opened so I expected slow service and I was right and it wasn't even packed. Employees had no training what so ever, its no blaze pizza but it's convenient\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] The food was good, really good. But the service wasn't as great. I ordered my pizza, when they finished and pulled it out they dropped about 20% of the pizza (toppings, cheese, and sauce). I brought it up to the Manager and asked if I wanted it to be made again, I didn't have time so I declined. He then just played it off and said like \"half off next time or something\". That felt like poor customer service to me.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Service is always good here, they're so patient with questions and the manager is always walking around, checking on guests and clearing the area. Definitely come for the pizzas, but I wouldn't recommend if you're just coming for salad. The Caesar salad I got looked more like a side salad and the lettuce was bruised. Plus side, plenty of bacon when I requested in sub of chicken.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I've been here about 4 times since it's opened and today I had my worst pizza! It was burnt! I didn't have time to make a deal about it because I was already running late to work. They were already running behind schedule I know but no excuse to burn a pizza! I'd rather be late to work with a good pizza instead of a burnt one. I did eat part of my pizza but It became too much after a few slices so i had to get rid of it! :(\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Not a fan.\n",

      "Kitchen was a MESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS.\n",

      "Pizza was swimming in water - I guess they don't drain the vegis before making.\n",
      "\n",
      "The concept is cool ... this location is not.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] While the the pizza is very good and the ingredients are fresh, the staff and atmosphere suck. They frequently don't pay attention to who orders what, don't take names to ensure food goes to the correct person, and are very \"whatever\" about everything in general. The choice of music is borderline offensive and way too loud to have a conversation. While I may visit again to buy a pizza, I'll only take it to go!\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] We came in on a Wednesday night after a busy day at work. There were about 10 people eating in and no one in line. They brought our pizzas to our table about 8 minutes after we ordered them. They were very good. I ordered the Buffalo chicken pizza. The flavor was good, especially if you are craving the chicken wings. It was spicier than I had expected and would describe it as medium heat versus a mild heat. That was good because it slowed me down from trying to inhale the whole pizza. The tables were clean and the soda machine was to the side for refills. Upon leaving I used the restroom and it was a single use restroom vs a stall system. It was clean as well. Definitely a good value as I have leftovers for lunch tomorrow.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Omg it's SOOOOOOO GOOD!!!! I am a frequent visitor of blaze pizza on decatur, but when this place opened right by house I couldn't WAIT to try it!! I got a build your own pizza with garlic herb butter and Alfredo sauce instead of red. Then I added ricotta, feta, spinach, mushrooms, cucumbers, basil, carrots, tomatoes, pepperoni, sausage,  oregano, and salt and pepper. I brought it home and omg I'm so glad it's so close! The staff was super friendly and very attentive. And they cook the pizzas so fast no wonder there's no wait. I definitely recommend coming here to try their pizzas. It's a little bit more expensive then Blaze but not by much and in my opinion, it's worth it. The only thing I could recommend to this place is to PLEASE GET GOAT CHEESE FOR THE PIZZAS. Other then that it's perfect\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] So I wait in line a good 5 minutes or so before getting to the create your pizza counter and when I finally get up there I'm told that the dough isn't vegan! I always ask even if I've been to a place a million times because you never know if recipes change. I guess PIEOLOGY HAS CHANGED THEIR RECIPE! \n",
      "Really though, how do you have VEGAN daiya cheese but not a vegan pizza dough?! The saddest part is that I've been here TWICE before and both times I was told that their crust was VEGAN! \n",
      "SO either I was being lied to the past two times I've come here and that I've been ingesting something that my morals and beliefs go against OR this employee and the manager he asked are incompetent when it comes to the food they serve their customers. \n",
      "Either way, there were pieces of mozzarella cheese floating around in the marinara which wasn't gonna fly with me any way. \n",
      "This sucks. I wanted pizza :(\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] This place is amazing. Great food. Great staff. Jose is the best.\n",
      "HIGHLY recommended.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I thought this pizza was delicious!  Better than their competitors.  My son was a little freaked out because his was dark around the edges.  So when I got home I just cut his edge off.  I am glad there is another great place to eat.  Clean, and refreshing.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I want to give this review 5 stars, but it seems as if the staff here is lacking customer service. While my pizza is always great, I can't say the same for my customer service experience. There's no greeting when you enter. Upon reaching the counter they stand there and look at you crazy. They're easily irritated when you take to long to look over the topping selection. When you have kids it takes them a min to decide. The counters never seem to be clean (Morning or evening). One employee had an attitude because I asked her to wipe the counter before she made my pizza. I have a food handlers card, and there were some rules being broken. It wasn't the cleanest. Yes messes will happen, but geesh. I'd hate to see them get less than an A. Evan is always pleasant and smiling. He makes sure you're satisfied. The girls attitudes are less than desirable. The management really needs to work on who they hire. I come here because the pizza is good, but am considering coming less or visiting another location simply because of the attitudes of some of the staff. Give Evan a promotion.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] This is the chipotle of pizzas.\n",
      "\n",
      "The options were almost overwhelming.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got the wheat crust and split the pizza, half red sauce and half white. I went with a veggie pizza on the white sauce side and meat on the red.\n",
      "\n",
      "They cook the pizzas really fast. I didn't have to wait too long at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will say that they did mess up a bunch of other people's orders around me. I chalk this up to the restaurant being new and the employees having a learning curve.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bathrooms were clean. There are a couple TVs broadcasting popular nonsense.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Excellent customer service and fresh, fast ingredients! Jake was very helpful and we will be ordering for more corporate lunches in the future!\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] First visit here. The food prep area was sloppy. Ingredients were blending into each other. Isn't there a manager watching over these bored kids making my pizza? I will go again but not excited to make it  back soon.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] So glad that there is finally a pieology near my house! I've been waiting for so long and I hated driving all the way to the flamingo location.\n",
      "\n",
      "The customer service in this branch is great! They're fast, friendly, and the workers always keep the restaurant clean and tidy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been here several times and they always make my pizza perfectly - crunchy crust and not a soggy middle!\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Not enough staff. Extremely slow. Pizza was burnt, but it sat so long waiting to be cut that it was cold. From now on I will be going to Blaze Pizza\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] This style of eating is one of my favorites.  Fresh ingredients ready to be topped on your own personal size pizza. They have all sorts of different sauces and cheeses as well. Did i mention UNLIMITED everything ?!? \n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing I could say that could've been better was that I would've liked a crispier crust.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] I love Pieology, but this location sucks. No one in the staff smiled or seemed happy to be there. They give you such a limited amount of toppings, and when I asked for more the woman helping me seemed irritated. I'm a paying customer and would have no problem paying for extra. I stood at the register waiting to pay without being acknowledged, and the employee had their back to the register and did not help me until another employee on break yelled hey someone is waiting on you. The whole staff needs to find a new job if they don't want to help people and know how to treat customers. I will continue going to the Summerlin location because I've never had that problem there.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] My favorite fast food pizza spot in town! This price is perfect for a nice sized pizza with unlimited toppings! Are you kidding me? Amazing! \n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend and I visited yesterday afternoon. We were greeted by an amazing girl. We told her that this was our first time there and she helped us without hesitation! She explained everything perfectly, what was popular, gave us advice about what toppings would go great. \n",
      "As a new vegetarian I was tempted to put meat in my pizza but they have plenty of protein substitutes that made my veggie pizza taste amazing! (cannellini beans). I can't wait to come back to try a different pizza!\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] The concept is unique; Jason and Z are wonderful Managers and ensured our experience was a pleasant visit.  The pizza's were DELICIOUS!!!!!!  Thanks\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] You can't go wrong with a custom pizza! Still working out some new opening kinks but overall excellent! Shout out to Romeo the pizza runner who was getting everyone their correct pizza even though the table numbers weren't matching up with correct pizza orders.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Finally was able to try this pizza place where you can pick and customize your very own pizza. The concept is pretty cool since you can pick as much items you want on the pizza. However the pizza was okay because the bottom of the pizza is very soggy and was not crispy. Maybe if they left it in the oven a little longer it would came out differently. It was a cool experience to try once.\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] My husband and I came here tonight for the first time and it was sooo amazing. Unlimited toppings?! Yes please! Your manager Jose was absolutely amazing. He helped us make some of our choices, and told us which things he's tried. Jose has amazing customer service skills. He was very helpful and makes a mean pie. The kind of pie you don't share because its yummy. Jose also hooked is up some free drinks...what a good guy and a hard worker!\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] This place wasn't as friendly as the last time I was here. I couldn't hear them saying \"hello welcome to pizzology\" the stuff was like zombies. There was two guys who I could hear them clearly and the rest (3) was like zombies. Please train your workers to speak up while talking to the customers, please and thanks!\n",
      "Pizza ['Pizza', 'Restaurants'] Talk about a very welcome addition to the neighborhood! \n",

      "For a quick serve pizza this is truly as good as it gets.  Great crust, fresh ingredients, excellent red sauce.  Portion size should be ideal for most people. \n",

      "Fast Food ['Fast Food', 'Restaurants'] This review is for the KFC located in Princes Mall, across from the new Sainsbury's. \n",
      "\n",
      "My first few months in Edinburgh were spent living near Princes Mall so a few times a week I would stop in for chicken here. Although there is another KFC location close by on Princes Street, I found this location to be much better. \n",
      "\n",
      "In general, the service is faster and the food is fresher. Also, the lobby is always being cleaned. Every time I have stopped in there someone is cleaning or wiping something. The free wifi is great as well, easy to connect to and pretty fast as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "The staff has not changed much since September, which tells me that management must do a good job at keeping their employees at least somewhat happy. They are fast with orders and have never gotten my order wrong. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only downside to this KFC is that during the early afternoons, it becomes a hang out spot for local teenagers out of school. Of course it is, it is located in a mall. But other than some increased noise, it isn't that big of a deal. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was surprised to see that a mall KFC was better than the one on Nicolson or Princes street, but it is. No doubt about it. I've walked to this one before just because I know my boneless dips will be fresher than the KFC on Nicolson Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a takeaway spot, this KFC is a good choice.\n",
      "Fast Food ['Fast Food', 'Restaurants'] This is surely the worst kFC in Edinburgh, possibly the world! We ordered the bargain bucket to share and when my twelve year old bit into one of the pieces she found it to be red raw. We took it back and asked the asian manager for a refund which he denied SHOUTING that the chicken was SUPPOSED TO BE THAT WAY- making my child cry. We left. Went to Burger King down in the station and thankfully saved our day, napkins helping to wipe up aforementioned childs tears!\n",
      "Fast Food ['Fast Food', 'Restaurants'] I hated the Goths and emos  who swarm all over the place, they stopped me from enjoying my popcorn chicken and fries. They also dont serve a free refill like in subway next door.\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] It really kills me to give it 2 stars especially since I was really excited to try this place. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "l'll start with the positive things\n",
      "\n",
      "I really liked the location of this place, great real estate choice. My husband and I really liked the interior of the restaurant, it has a modern touch to it. The place was clean and looked new inside ( because it is new) so we really liked that. Also the chicken with my meal was good but i'll elaborate on that so continue reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now for the negative\n",
      "\n",
      "WHERE THE HELL IS THE MARKET?!?!?! It can't possibly be the display area with the chips.\n",
      "\n",
      "So when you walk in its hard to see and read the menu. They have them posted up high and the print is small so it's hard to see and read but no big deal. We did notice that they had 3 huge screens by the front door which we are assuming are meant to display the menu in bigger print but it wasn't on. We were in a pasta mood but they didn't really have many pasta options which was a bummer. Aside from the lasagna that seems to be a regular on the menu we ordered from the \"specials\" menu which was pretty much a protein (chicken or sausage) prepared differently, served with fettuccini and different sauce according to the protein option.\n",
      "I ordered parmesan chicken with fettuccini. My husband got a pasta with sausage and a pink sauce I think it was. My husbands sausage (see what i did there) was thinly cut which wasn't the problem but it looked and had the texture of mushrooms. The sausage had no texture and the sauce was more on the goopy side and bland. My dish was better, but not by much. I will say my chicken parmesan was good. The chicken was moist, was salty, saucy and cheesy. The pasta / fettuccini however was a different story. I felt as if the pasta was more of an afterthought, didn't feel like it went with my meal which is weird and its such a simple dish which is why I was disappointed and slightly confused. Also the sauce was........ good/ fine, it wasn't greasy or gross which is a good thing but I was turned off by a metallic/electric cooker taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe pasta isn't their thing and maybe their subs, pizza or calzones are the better options. This place has soooooo much potential but the entire restaurant is sort of confusing, I thought it was a sit down and order type of place but its an order and then sit type of spot which I think they should switch that up ( due to trendy ambiance and size) but not a deal breaker.  Honestly thinking about it now the place reminded me of Sbarro with a cool and trendy interior. Not sure if its worth the money to get Sbarro quality food in a trendy joint. This is probably the thanks I get for not cooking this evening.\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] I don't usually post but don't order any pasta dishes. Family of five, different meals and nothing good. Had high hopes when we were told by the cashier all pasta was freshly made. We had to go next door to Roberto's because no one could finish their food. Extremely mad I spent $75 on a terrible dinner.\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] It was my first time here and the staff was so nice! They greeted us at the door and explained how everything is fresh! They reserved a table for us right away and they had a DJ tonight! Such a great place! We will be back!\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] Location has issues with an extremely busy parking lot. Staff is very friendly. Management/owner continuously circles the restaurant ensuring everyone is happy & satisfied. Salads are larger for eat-in but still good sized & very well priced. The Angry Sicilian large is really big. Stick with the small. Variety on the sandwich is great. Homemade mozzarella is creamy and tasty. Might want to try adding maybe a mustard (something with a little bite) to make it perfect. Only negative is with the pricing. Dinner for 3 (salad, 2 lg sandwiches, 1 soda, 2 beers + 4 cannoli) almost $70. Definitely better tasting than Subway but we could eat at Subway 2+ times for one visit here. Still, very satisfied & will be back to try other menu items.\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] I was recently told about this place by my best friend and I was happy to hear that finally, a place like Cugino's Italian Deli & Pizza by UNLV is now on the southwest side of town. There has not been many good \"family-owned\" style places in town or many at all. Besides Cugino's by UNLV as previously mentioned, Nora's on Flamingo between Jones and Decatur, and Roma Deli on Spring Mountain between Jones and Decatur, I don't think there are many others like them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Came here for a small \"in-between meal\" eats after the gym the other day (ssssh don't judge). Conveniently located on Warm Springs, just west of Durango, in the same shopping center as SkinnyFats, it now resides in the previously known Mac Shack location. Décor is pretty nice with TVs mounted on the wall. A \"wall\" rack with ingredients (similar to Cuginos and Roma Deli) most likely used in their own food as well dividing the restaurant from the line to order and the seating area. Decent amount of seating including seating outside. Also some bar seats for those who come here alone and don't wanna take up an entire table yourself. \n",
      "\n",
      "Offerings are a bit different than previously mentioned places but has pieces of what the others are popular for as well. They do fresh made pizzas with some specialties as well as building your own. Also cold and hot sandwiches (or build your own as well) and chef's daily specials. Boar's head branded deli meats is no newbie to the Las Vegas market and this place doesn't fail to do so as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Always being one to pick the one with the most stuff, I easily picked the \"Angry Sicilian\" sandwich. The sandwich consists of prosciutto, capicola, soppressata, mortadella, house-made mozzarella topped with roasted red peppers, lettuce, tomatoes, onions and drizzled with some extra virgin olive oil, red wine vinegar, and a sprinkle of oregano.... all on your choice of either sesame load, multi-gran loaf, italian loaf, pizza bianca (flatbread), or rye bread. For a small size, it was $9, large $14.95. And of course, I went for the large. (NO I did not eat it all. remember I said small \"in-between meal\" ? I only ate half, saved half for another day. Ive always been a fan of Italian meats over the traditional deli meats (ham, turkey, roast beef, etc) as it brings so much more depth and flavor. Mozzarella is also one of my favorite cheeses ! Light, smooth thick slices of a mild cheese made traditionally with water buffalo milk... Mmm :) Wonder if they sell mozzarella by itself ? Om nom nom hahaha. Overall, super flavorful sandwich which brings memories of my frequent visits to Cugino's when I went to UNLV. a MUST GET if you cant decide on what to get ! \n",
      "\n",
      "Cant wait to come here again and try other things ! UNFORTUNATELY ! (boohoo... xD) its so close to EOS gym... HEHE :) and sonics... happy hour half drinks (strawberry limeade...) and suzuya for dessert... LOL XD sssh im a piggy ... \n",
      "\n",
      "Ate the leftover sandwich the next day. Still pretty good. As it was already a \"cold\" sandwich, pulling it out of the fridge maybe 15 minutes before eating it made it as good as it was freshly made\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] Visited after seeing on Yelp that a Roast Pork, Broccoli Rabe and Provolone sandwich was on the menu I'm giving 5 stars in anticipation of when a different bread supplier will be used, since the bread on my sandwich didn't stand up to the sandwich. Clean store, concerned employees. Oddly, there is a Jersey Mikes adjacent. That's like having a Taco Bell next to a real Mexican restaurant.\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] 2nd visit to Plantone's today, pizza was fabulous.  Crust was perfect, and toppings were fresh and tasted great.

      "We ordered mozzarella caprese which was delish. Tomatoes so fresh and that mozzarella mmmmm. The hubby ordered the pizza with pepperoni and sausage. Crust was just right. Not burnt or under cooked. He said that his pizza was great cheese and sauce just right. I ordered the spaghetti bolognese. WOW was that just delightful. Flavors all around for just a simple pasta. \n",
      "\n",
      "Plantone's has a new pasta everyday. So it would be awesome if I could try their new pasta everyday. Lol! The price is very reasonable. Not no crazy Italian price which will empty my wallet. So maaaaybe I can go everyday and try their different kind of pasta.\n"

      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] The food is good. No question about it, but the pricing is all over the board. Pizza/calzones are underpriced and pasta is super overpriced. Example:  $11 for 1 cup of pasta with 3 small slices of not toasted bread. No prices on the menu for drinks. Small fountain drink is around $2.50; a tad high.  Meatball sub was amazing. This place is not on the level of Cugino's on Maryland, but could get there with some slight changes.  Thank god they didn't call the place \"Tony Boloney's\".\n",

They took over the old Mac Shack location and rennovated the inside. Had a great experience there and wanted to share with everyone. The staff there were all super friendly, the food was tasty and had good value. We shared a Caesar salad and a huge Mushroon/Sausage Calzone (total $16). Apparently they make everything in-house, their pastas, sauces, etc. They have pizzas, subs, calzones, salads and other quick italian fare. Give it a try if you're in the area.\n",

I order the caprese salad and add prosciutto on the side. They make their own mozzarella! They make fresh pasta for their pasta of the day! Fettuccine was the pasta of day and I had it with bolognese sauce and added meatballs. The meatballs were tender and flavorful. They didn't skimp on the sauce. They just open in December and i hope they are here for awhile. Next time I am in I want to try their antipasto board.\n",

      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] Great place to stop by for a quick bite. Pizza is Neapolitan style....thin middle, thicker edge with a nice chew. Sandwiches looked very large & tasty. The staff was super friendly and very informative. They explained just about anything you wanted to know. Tvs & tables inside and a nice little fire pit lounge area outside along with table seating. Not quite sure why they call it an Italian market though. Very slim pickings for that.\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] Came here for dinner last night and had a great experience! Had the buy 1 get 1 free large pizza. Tried the Tony Pepperoni and Bianco Pizzas. Very good! There was a gentleman by the name of Roberto who was amazing to say the least. From the time we walked in, during our dining and until we left - his customer service was above and beyond. Haven't tried anything else and their menu isnt huge however do to this experience I will definitely come back. Thank you!\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] I was pleasantly surprised by the updates to both the dining area and outside patio from the previous restaurant. The lasagna was amazing, pizza was good as well.  We had the Nutella cheesecake, it was okay, I wouldn't get it again but will be back.\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] I went to this place to try it out last week and I was pretty disappointed. There are a lot of kinks to work out in terms of logistics. I went there to place my order after work- (so like 6pm during the workweek) and it's not busy at all. I go to place my order and the cashier, a blonde girl, says \"Hold on! I'm not ready yet!\" The thing is, I hadn't said a word. I was 'holding on'...not the greatest first impression, but young people get stressed out easily. I just wait until she is ready. Finally, she calls me over and then as soon as I start to speak she tells me to hold on again so she can answer the phone. Meanwhile, there are like 25 employees all everywhere trying to create a fun environment but just trying too hard and making it super awkward. One guy asks me my name, I tell him and then he tells the rest of the staff and they keep saying my name every  chance they get thinking this is somehow a catchy marketing ploy? I'm not sure but it was obnoxious. So finally, girl is off the phone and I'm ready to order now. Then, the phone rings again- no apologies, nothing.  She just answers. I'm visibly pissed and she recognizes that so she placed the caller on hold this time so I could finally order. After about a 10 minute dance with her, I place my order. Sandwich and individual pizza. She tells me 30 mins. What?!? Jesus! I paid already so whatever- I decide to drive directly across the street to Von's to pick up some stuff. I haven't even parked... Less than 5 minutes had passed and some man calls and tells me my order is ready and to come pick it up. I ask him how that's possible? 5 mins ago, I was told 30 mins. He repeated my order to me. I confirmed and he said yup, ready. Weird but ok. Even better. So I go across the street again- (if you know this area, you know how impossible this can be during this time of day) and I finally make it and go to pick up my order. I get there and, of course, my order was not ready. They did however, say my name at least 20 more times to add to this lovely experience. I finally got my food. It was correct and edible which is why they get two stars. Mediocre quality at best. Two stars is generous, trust me. Soggy pizza and bland sandwich. \n",
      "\n",
      "Suggestion: Service matters as much, if not more than the product. Please keep your eyes on the face of your business. (Ashley, I think was her name) Also, invest in some salt and pepper and make sure all moving parts are communicating with each other so you have a decent shot at a first impression. Finally, quality control. Pizza was super soggy because it was not timed to be ready when the sandwich was. \n",
      "\n",
      "Best of luck to you folks- I love supporting mom and pop shops- hopefully this experience was the exception and not the rule.\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] This place is amazing!!! Staff is friendly and helpful, offering suggestions and answering any questions you may have regarding the menu. They allowed us to sit on the patio with our 2 dogs and even brought out some water for them! I have enjoyed the Italian sausage and sweet peppers, chicken parm sandwich and the caprese sandwich. The chicken parm was great, but a bit much with the bread. The Italian sausage and caprese sandwiches were amazing! Perfect balance of fresh ingredients! I can't wait to come back and try something else new!\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] For a strip mall Italian place, it's very good. The inside is comfortable and nice. Had the pasta of the day -- meat sauce -- and the noodles were clearly homemade and good. Cannoli was good as well. I hope the place succeeds.\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] This place was fantastic!  The food was delicious and the atmosphere couldn't have been better!  Tony helped me personally to receive the dish that I ordered and Glenn (Owner) stopped by and we chatted at length about his vision coming to reality and how cool it will be to dine outside on the patio when it warms up a bit.  Authentic and High Quality Italian Cuisine - We loved it and will return soon!\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] I've been pretty excited to see an authentic Italian shop open down the street from me. Sometimes I cringe when I see the prices but it really comes down to the flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've had the pleasure of trying their Alfredo pasta during my first visit. You can absolutely taste the texture difference of the pasta of how it is homemade versus store bought. It was soft, maybe too soft for some people's liking, flavorful and just delicious. They packed in garlic in the sauce and it's exactly the way I would've wanted it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried the Roast Pork Italian hot sandwich. I did wish to have a small cup for a little more au ju to dip my sandwich in, but it surprisingly remained slightly moist the whole time. I'm not usually a big fan of broccoli rabe with the bitterness but it perfectly countered the pork, juice and the bread. This sandwich surprised the hell out of me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do feel like you get the most bang for your buck with their Philly Cheesesteak. This sandwich was just plain greasy and so damn delicious. I wish I asked for extra provolone cheese because I could not get enough of it. I also had them add all the peppers, onions and mushrooms and they were sautéed perfectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did try their white Bianca pizza and added some basil pesto to it and this was also awesome. I plan to try all their pizzas at some point. They offer a buy one, get one Happy Hour special between 4pm-7pm for any of their 10\" pizzas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also at first I was a bit upset that the two cannoli's were $5.50, but they are seriously the best cannoli's I've ever had. I wish they were a little cheaper but it was definitely worth it.\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] Plantone's has been on my radar since it popped up on Yelp. I was kind of wondering what kind of experience I would have since the reviews have been mostly good with a few bad reviews. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I walked in... It wasn't clear what you were supposed to do... So I was lost for a split second until I saw the arrows on the ground. Basically this is a place where you order and you are given a number and they bring out to the food to you. So as soon as you walk in... Look to your right and walk through the little aisle and look through the menus that are hanging on chalkboards or you could grab and to go menu and look through that instead. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was greeted right away and I told them I needed a second as it was first time... And at that point they could've explained the menu to me but instead they just left me alone which ended up being fine as I was ok with just looking through the menu. When I did finally make it up to the cashier I think I surprised her. She had her back to us and jumped about a mile when she turned around and saw us! Lol it was hilarious. :D\n",
      "\n",
      "I placed my order with her and was given a number... And proceeded to wait. \n",
      "\n",
      "The ambiance is actually really cute! They have boxes of dried pasta and jars of olives lining the aisle that your walk to place your order... The only odd item was Cheetos....I would not expect Cheetos in an Italian restaurant. But the music was very fun... Now I can't think of any of the songs that I heard but I remember thinking that it was very cute and very fun Italian music...:) They also have 3 TV's against the wall playing mainly sports. Lots of cute tables with plenty of seating. The only weird thing was a bar type seating in the middle of the dining room... It was weird because when you sit in that bar type seating you are basically looking onto the tables that are lined up against it... If I was sitting at the table beneath it...I would kind of feel a little weird to have a stranger looking onto my table... But all good. I might just be a weirdo!! Lol\n",
      "\n",
      "They have a decent sized menu with lots of different items on it which I will definitely be back for. \n",
      "\n",
      "I got the fried baloney sandwich... Which is basically a fried mortadella sandwich. The menu said ciabatta bread but it was just served on a white bread in the shape of a ciabatta roll. The mustard added the right amount of tang to the sandwich... But I wished that she would've mentioned that I could've added an egg to it...I later saw the pictures of the sandwich with a fried egg and they looked delish!! Overall, it was okay... BUT very very greasy. After I had a couple of bites, my hands and my mouth were covered in grease. Flavor 3.5/5 I also got the Italian pork sandwich with the broccoli rabe.... As soon as I saw the words broccoli rabe I was hooked. The sliced pork was tender but a little on the dry side but Amy the cashier thoughtfully brought us a side of au jus and when I dunked the sandwich into the au jus....omg it was perfection!!! It added so much flavor and a little kick... The broccoli rabe was cooked great so that it wasn't​ mushy and had a great bite to it. Overall, the sandwich was a little messy....duh.... You dunk it into the au jus which totally saturated the bread... So worth all the extra napkins that you needed to wipe up the juices dribbling down your chin. Lol flavor 5/5\n",
      "\n",
      "Will I be back heck yeah! It was delicious! Then why the 4 star instead of a 5 star? Maybe it had to do with the fact that I went there an hour before close but I had to wait a little over 20 minutes to get my food which in my books is a little too long. Hopefully I'll be able to go during lunch one day and see if the wait time is better. :)\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] Just Okay.. Bread was below average.. pasta above average..  nothing great.. nothing really awesome so far... Ill be back to try other items.\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] One of my regular go to neighborhood restaurants the angry Sicilian is is legit and lasagna is really good.  The Italian bread is soft and light perfect for a sandwich. Not everything is great on the menu but these two items have me coming back on a regular basis. Nice outdoor seating area as well.\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] We order their Pizza on the happy hour by one 10 inch pizza get one free. Me and my wife did not like it. That was super thin dough that was super soggy. Was not a fan of their Pizza did not try anything else sandwiches do look good\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] Amazing! Reminds me of a east coast deli! Really enjoyed it. My husband had a pizza and I had a panini. Both were delicious. The staff was super nice and made sure we were happy. I look forward to going again\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] Went for the for the Grand Opening. They encouraged people to start camping out at 12:00am. It didn't happen. We got there at 8 A.M. with 4 people in line. We ended up 7th and 10th in line by 8:30 ish.\n",
      "\n",
      "LET ME TELL YOU! People are hitting themselves for missing this. Great open atmosphere, awesome patio for when it gets warmer. The staff beyond amazing. The poor guy who had to stand outside and keep things organized amazing. Explained everything to the T, and kept calm. They even had people park at Vons's walk over and without a doubt he knew what spot you were in. By 10:45 it was at 100. \n",
      "\n",
      "At 11:00 when they opened it was spot on amazing. You walked in knowing what you wanted, as they handed out menus. It was a easy flow. They have been open a month or so, and the place still seems very clean and organized. Every employee knew what their task was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food: 5/5\n",
      "\n",
      "With a mass opening like this I thought the few good 10 orders would be kinda a shock and have a few things wrong. Nope. So then I thought at least one person would have something wrong. Nope. The only problem was Togo or dinein. But if that's your issue. By all means you rocked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pizza Blanca: AMAZING! The cheeses and the Onion compliment it so well, but the bites of chicken set it off. The crust is great. Has some char-marks but not burnt. If you like it a little more krispy just ask, they will handle it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Pesto Chicken Pizza: Actually is very good. My partner loved it. I thought it was very good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chicken Parm Sandwich: So we shared food with a gentleman named John in line. Which was awesome. He gave us each a piece of his sandwich. I must say their red sauce is amazing. To die for. With the small piece of chicken (because i got the middle of the two cutlets, in a large sandwich) was cooked very well. Not to much coating at the end of the chicken as filler. Hands down was great. \n",
      "\n",
      "Glen the owner is very kind. Can talk to anyone! Staff is 5/5. I can't wait to see how this place grows! Congrats!\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] Good service,  good food! First time here and the food/ingredients were fresh & tasty, Definitely will be back again. \n",
      "Loved the cheesesteak and the mac n cheese was very very good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update; second visit on Sunday afternoon was so so and careless by cook.\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] Great place to eat amazing food. Best sandwich I have had in Vegas since I moved here. Homemade fresh mozzarella is out of control too. If you want great Italian food, this is the place.\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] The lasagna was quite tasty.   They were out of minestrone soup at 1 pm on a Sunday, which was a big disappointment to the wife.   I was surprised that they did not serve bread with the entree Lasagna.   Portions were large.  Good music mix and nice seating in the dining room.  Nice outdoor dining area.  Parking will be a problem here.\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] Wonderful place  to eat with family! The Atmosphere is awesome! Sam is awesome he's the head cook I believe! Roberto & Marina & Amanda are awesome as well great customer Service skills! All of the staff there takes pride in there work!  Great place love, love it!\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] I was really excited to try this place as I live near it and love Italian food. Unfortunately I have nothing good to say about Plantone's, the ordering/line is confusing, there's no \"market\" at all and the food is tiny (which is especially insulting based on the high prices here).\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] $13.50 for a dry, average sandwich, a bag of chips, and a soda? Nah. I'm good. I was excited to try this place because I often went to the previous establishment. The environment is decent and the music is great. But man... that chicken parmesan sandwich was so dry and lacking in flavor. I even added the \"fresh mozzarella\" - didn't help much. I may give this plan one more shot considering it's 4star rating here among users. Maybe I got the worst thing on the menu? I've had a better sandwich at Subway for 1/2 the cost. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tried it again, second time with the same order (to be fair) and the same results. My sandwich was dry, slightly over cooked (or sitting too long), and to me the value is just not there for $12-13. Perhaps I'm ordering the wrong item? I'm willing to give it one more try.  Once again, the service was great. The place is very clean. And I will say my experience was better than last time, I just expect a bit more for that price with a sandwich.\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] Melody is she is one of the employees you almost think  that she is the owner lol!! Very patient very knowledgeable  excellent customer service took the time out to assist me with my The selections of food!  I did not feel rushed at all ! the establishment is clean the bathrooms are clean and the food is well prepped and is very fresh The  sauces are authentic ! very Italian , kind of like a New York City setting ! I would recommend this to anyone and it is also conveniently located right off the freeway as well!\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] My favorite Italian place near the house. So far I tried the pizza, the eggplant sandwich, a few kinds of soup and the kids meal for my little and so far I love everything I tasted. They are very nice too. Suggest checking out this place. They also have happy hour. Modern industrial decor, nice patio, ESPN channel and nice music.\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] Updated:\n",
      "A few of us went back a second time to this place for lunch last week. I went on the web site and placed an order for a cheesesteak. I had a lot of specific requests for my sandwich. I arrived at the restaurant around 12:10pm and went to the cashier to pay for my order. The manager, who didn't know that I was standing behind him told the cook,  to double check the special requests. I then told him that it was my order. He advised me that my order will be ready in a minute or so. The sandwich was delicious!  Several minutes later, the manager came up to my table and asked me if the order was made correctly.  I really hope that this place keeps up the great work with regards to the food and service. I'll be definitely returning here again for the third time in a few more days! Thanks..\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] Found this place on yelp... so glad I did.  Let me start by saying this place gets it.. and is top notch. \n",
      "Amazing quality, really great service from everyone. Prices are very fair especially for what you get. \n",
      "I made a pig of myself but you only live once....  we will be back here again.\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] 5 stars is simply not enough for this restaurant! Everything on the menu is authentic and delicious! You walk in and immediately you feel at home. Everything is made in house daily and it shows in all the dishes! So happy to finally find a place like this in Vegas!\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] Ordered a large Sicilian thinking it would be big enough for 2-3 people for the price of $14.95 but it wasn't. A little soggy when we took it home. Ordered margarita pizza which was good but cold. But 9.00 for a small sandwich! THats ridiculous! I would of rather of gone to jersey mikes next door!  $34 for 2 sandwiches and a personal pizza is ridiculous!! Sandwiches didn't have much flavor either. Don't know if I'll be back!\n",
      "Pizza ['Italian', 'Pizza', 'Delis', 'Restaurants'] I chose to try this place rather than my original Skinny Fats destination.  I'm so glad I did!  The Angry Sicilian is the best sandwich I've had in awhile.  The ingredients all tasted fresh.  They didn't have much in place as far as pasta dishes go, but this clearly isn't a pasta shop.  I'll be making this my go-to sandwich shop.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Food', 'Arts & Entertainment', 'Art Galleries', 'Shopping', 'Coffee & Tea'] Perfectly relaxing ambiance with artistic decor. Friendly staff. Tasty food (had the delicious Turkey BLT today). Wonderfully balance cup of cafe latte (soy and vanilla flavor available).\n",
      "\n",
      "They also have a drive-thru option if you're in a hurry.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Food', 'Arts & Entertainment', 'Art Galleries', 'Shopping', 'Coffee & Tea'] The staff sucks beyond rude. Shouldn't be in business. Don't know how to make drinks. Don't waste your time or money going to this place. The nut job lady in the morning needs to be on meds.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Food', 'Arts & Entertainment', 'Art Galleries', 'Shopping', 'Coffee & Tea'] I purchased the Yelp deal and wasn't able to use it; none of the staff even knew about it. It wasn't a huge deal at the time (though it really would have been nice to use!), but I will be pretty upset if it expires.\n",
      "Coffee & Tea ['Food', 'Arts & Entertainment', 'Art Galleries', 'Shopping', 'Coffee & Tea'] Awful. The sweat panted ( hey put a little effort in to it ) crabby ( if you you think your job sucks find a different one ) ' barista' ( being able to work an espresso machine is not that much more difficult than a mr coffee) at least gave me some fodder for crappy service reviews. Lazy, dirty, and angry is no way to garner tips. I didn't drink the coffee afraid she spit in it.\n",

      "German ['German', 'Restaurants'] Ein Lokal ganz nach meinem Geschmack! Bei meinem ersten Besuch viel mir die liebevolle Dekoration des ganzen Lokales auf. Richtig gemütlichDas Angebot an Speißen und Getränken ist vielfältig. Von Salaten in diversen Varianten bis hin zu deftigen Rouladen mit Rotkohl ist alles vorhanden.\n",

      "Ich freue mich immer wieder auf einen gemütlichen Abend im Smart.\n",
      "German ['German', 'Restaurants'] gemütliches kleines Cfé, gute Speisekarte mit leichter Kost, von französischer, zur italienische bis hin zur deutsche Küche. Echt ein süßes feines Café, und auch ganz schön romantisch!\n",
      "German ['German', 'Restaurants'] Wir häten gewarnt sein müssen. Ein Restaurant in bester Lage am Sonntag um 19 Uhr mit nur zwei Gästen. Aber das Lokal ist neu, die Speisekarte sah gut aus und wir waren neugierig. Der kleine Salat war recht unfangreich und bestand haupsächlich aus Blattsalaten.\n",
      "Der Rostbraten war schön dick,groß und weich. Wenn man aber die braune Soße und die ebenso braunen, bis zur Unkenntlichkeit zerkochten, süßlich schmeckenden Zwiebeln  entfernt hat, kam ein bleiches Stück Fleisch zum vorschein. Der Anschnitt war ebenfalls blass und so schmeckte es auch. Die so genannten Bratkartoffeln bestanden aus groben Kartoffelstücken, z.T. mit Schale und waren wohl in der Friteuse gemacht. Den als Entschädigung angebotenen Kaffee haben wir abgelehnt.\n",
      "Das Lokal ist pflegeleicht, ohne jegliche Dekoration.\n",
      "Helle Wände, dunkles Holz und dunkler Boden. Als wir gingen, waren vier Gäste im Restaurant, die Lounge war voll.\n",
      "German ['German', 'Restaurants'] Schön, das es sowas noch gibt! Eine Köchin, die auch mal den Strammen Max mit Käse überbackt oder die Schnitzel ganz dünn klopft, wenn man das möchte. Urgemütliches Lokal mit einem Wirt aus dem United Kingdom , was unglaublich hilft, das eingerostete Schulenglisch aufzupolieren.\n",
      "Also ganz reizende Wirtsleute, komunikativ, sauber und ehrlich.\n",
      "Fühle mich hier sehr wohl.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] My favorite place to grab Mexican food.  Green chili is a little too mild but still my favorite chili in burros. The best green chili is at the Burger House in Miami, AZ.  Both restaurants, from what I hear have 'shared' recipes with some minor liberties. \n",
      "Tacos more often than not, are over cooked/burned shells, but still better than the competition.\n",
      "Architecturally outdated interior but I think it's intentional.  Doesn't matter since I only order 'to go' here.\n",
      "In the mafia, they call it 'made men',,,since they are family owned and operated, the younger staff are an entitled bunch, so don't expect to get personable service.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] The worst, most unfriendly service, awful salsa, overpriced and did I mention it took forever to get our food?\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] New location Rocks. It's very nice and new. Nice move!  Had #5 great tasting. Fair prices. Go before the snowbirds get back.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] This place was the first good Mexican restaurant that I've found since moving to AZ 2 years ago!  The burro Xavier's way was awesome.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] Not too much to love or hate about this place.  Traditional Mexican fare for the masses.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] Food as usual is amazing. Never disappointed. Only thing that would make it better is if they sold beer.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] Went for dinner with a party of 7. Food came out at different times for our table which was totally unprofessional. Burritos were small and had hardly any meat! The rice was horrible, sticky,no flavor. Will never go back or recommend it to anyone!!!\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] The food it hot and \"globish\" the enchilada sauce has a tangy cinnamony flavor I must have missed the onion the taco is good the meat is roast beef but could use a bit more meat. The relleno is tasty not much spice it could use the green sauce on it. The chips were solid good the salsa was surprisingly spicey good flavor an undamiliar spice in there maybe cinnamon. \n",
      "All in all it was a good meal.. filling satisfying and tasty.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] This is my go to place for home style Mexican!  Love the green chili burrito (get it 'smothered' enchilada style) and the machaca tacos!  My daughter who is 4 is a die hard bean burrito fan!  When we are at Mexican restaurants she will ask the server if they make the beans like Xavier!\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] Unbelievable! You haven't had Mexican food until you've eaten here. Everything I've had on the menu has been made me feel like I died and gone to heaven. I recommend anything with green chile on it.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] We come here regularly. We used to get only to-go orders but since the new location opened we have been dining in probably half the time now. This is a different type of Mexican food, I grew up calling it Globe style (Globe-Miami, AZ has a unique style and this is identical, in fact the owners I believe are from that area). Most people love it but I'm sure some won't, I haven't taken a person yet who didn't love it though. Salsa is great and unique. Love the cheese crisps to start. We used to just order lots of burritos and salsa to-go but since dining in we have switched to combos and they are always delish. I have not personally had one bad experience with food or service and always recommend this place to anyone wanting good Mexican food.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] Ordered a chicken taco, beef taco, tostada, bean burrito, chips. Paid 22.00. Chicken taco very small and tasteless/oily, same with the beef, pathetically small portions, no flavor, tostada had soggy lettuce and no cheese to speak of. Presentation very poor. Unfortunately once again coming from California, Arizonans don't know Mexican food if they rate this as high as they do. I would have better off going to Del Taco even though I wouldnt.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] This place has now moved locations to Higley/Southern, right next to our house :) The new establishment is very well put together and the food and service are still excellent. We eat here at least once a week. One improvement, some days the chips taste a bit stale. All in all I still give Xaviers 5 stars.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] If you want some great Mexican food eat here.  It's a family ran Bussines and they are all really nice. I usually get the butter bean burrito with a side of rice.  All around good place to go.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] Great food. Great staff. I actually set up a yelp account just to write this review. Awsome.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] Our family has been going here practically since I was born.  For almost 30 years starting at the Tempe location.  The Reynoso family originally started in Tempe but we find that this location of the daughter's family is better.  It is nice when we get to speak to the owner daughter.  Better points of the Mesa location rather than the Chandler or Tempe location is that they put more in your burrito or just give you more food for the price you pay and they seem more down to earth and comfortable to be around their family and servers give pleasant customer service.  \n",

      "Now on to the rating....the refried bean and cheese burrito is the best!  They make their refried beans from scratch everyday!  If you get it in the restaurant they butter the top of the burrito which is delicious.  If you get it \"to go\" they don't unless you ask and specify it.  Next, their Salsa is Amazing!  It is the best salsa I've ever tasted.  A little watery but Amazing!  Not to hip on their tortilla chips, their chips are heavy and somewhat chewy and not light and airy like they should be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their \"Gollo Burro\" and \"Machaca\" are pretty good in taste.  Although many times the Burro is not full and the Machaca is not very well packed with shredded beef or sometimes they can be just skimpy on the ingredients in general depending on the day.  But definitely not as bad as the Chandler and Tempe locations in being skimpy or giving to little food for the price you pay.  Out of the two the \"Gollo Burro\" is the Best in taste.  I believe it's the green chili that does it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their tacos and enchiladas are nothing special.  The tacos are chewy in the shell rather than crunchy and again can many times have little in them.  The enchiladas are small for the price you pay and do not have much in them either.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Their Chili Rellenos \"eehh\".  I've had better made from my mom.  Again very little in them.  Would like to see a really fat stuffed great tasting one with amazing cheese and shredded beef.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last but not least....Their Cheese Crisp is crisp, buttery, and deeeelicious!  Just the right amount of cheese...(lots;)  And it is especially delicious dipped in their salsa!\n",
      "\n",
      "So here's the deal!  If you dine in get two bean and cheese burritos, chips and salsa, and a large cheese crisp as an appetizer wash it down with a soda and you'll have an amazing lunch or dinner.  Make sure ya bring a friend or you'll never finish the cheese crisp alone!;)\n",
      "\n",
      "P.S.  If ya want to try something more than a burrito, definitely try the \"Gollo Burro\"!\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] So was expecting a lot from this place based on a friends review and was let down they did not meet my expectations. The service was ok and the food was good but not great. The chili relleno was gross! It tasted like old fryer oil. I would go back because everything else was good but stay away from the relleno for sure..\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] You haven't had a bean burro until you've had one at Casa Reynoso. This is one of the first places I ate at when I visited Phoenix for the first time a few years ago and the cheese crisp lives in my heart as one of my top five comfort foods.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place is no frills, a hole in the wall if there ever was one. It has a lived in look to it and the decor could use a spruce, but I don't come to look at the walls, I come to eat. It seats maybe 50 people so avoid the lunch or dinner rush because there will be a wait! But it's definitely worth it. Casa Reynoso has a pretty simple menu of burros, tacos, enchiladas, chimichangas, enchiladas and would fall under the category of just another Mexican restaurant if the food wasn't so consistently GREAT. As a new Arizona local I have to say I'm loving the fact that green chiles are an option pretty much everywhere and CR is no exception.\n",
      "\n",
      "As mentioned, the cheese crisp (with green chile of course) is a favorite. A crispy tortilla topped with delicious melty cheese and green chile. It's cut up like a pizza and meant to be shared, but really I would fight someone to eat the whole thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prices are dirt cheap-your most expensive meal is maybe $15. The portion sizes are generous and they don't skimp on the meat. Service can be hit or miss, but I've accepted it for what it is...I do it for the cheese crisp!\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're looking for a casual meal and a place where sweatpants can be worn without judgement, Casa Reynoso is your place.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] Love how the salsa is hot, the items are made to order, and the chips are freshly made. OMFG - cant wait to see their new location. Only complaint is that they close at 9 and their chicken tastes like rotisserie chicken.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] Classic Mexican food for a really great price. They have really good enchilada sauce their tacos are very good. I love the special bean burro with green chili and butter.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you love Mexican food you gotta try this place out.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] Their bean and cheese burritos along with the salsa on top is a guilty pleasure of mine...\n",
      "\n",
      "Tried a green chili chicken enchilada today and enjoyed it! Just the right amount of spice and full of flavor. \n",
      "\n",
      "Prices are great, authentic food! Try it, you won't be disappointed!\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] Its ok. This place has a unique flavor. Origanely from Miami-Globe area, they have expanded down here in the valley. They have a strong following. I have eaten here about 10 times, cause of location.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] I usually go to Joanna's at mill/southern in Tempe. Was I'm this part of town during lunch so stopped by.  Green chili burro was good. Taco was burnt. Taking my bean burro w me. Waitress brought my food and never came back but to give my togo. Very disappointed.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] It was good, but not great. The prices are good, but in both burro's we ordered, there was only a very small amount of meat in the middle of both burro's. It was a bit of a rip off in that sense. \n",
      "Flavours were good, but you can get a massive meat stuffed burrito at Filiburtos for 5.50. \n",
      "The taco was pretty terrible. The tamale had so much masa that it was literally inedible. \n",
      "The chips and salsa are great. \n",
      "The best thing is the green chile burro, green style, but again, 4 chunks of meat in the middle doesn't make up for the price.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] If you want the real thing, take the time to actually drive to Miami/Globe. This place is nothing like the food you get in Miami/Globe and just because they are extended family doesn't mean that you are getting same quality of food. While service was friendly, the food was not worth a first trip. Tostada was soggy and dripped liquid, they charge for chips that come in a bowl no bigger than the salsa bowl, and cleanliness was questionable. I truly do not like to write bad reviews, and generally don't. But there are so many better choices for both quality and value.  If you want Miami/Globe style, then take time to drive there. No extension comes close.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] If your not a fan of fresh salsa, savory enchilada sauces and a kiss of fresh melted butter on your burro but rather you get excited for those preservative rich strait from the can joints with an army of microwaves in the kitchen to make your food, well then you'll hate this place.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] First time there but definitely not the last. Read the reviews and thought we would give it a try. The food was delicious. I had the combo of relleno and enchilada and my hubby had the signature burro. We loved the food. The refrained beans were out of this world, rice was very good, and everything else was exceptional. \n",
      "\n",
      "The place is not fancy but with good food you don't need anything fancy. It's in a strip shopping center. Definitely worth a second & third & fourth, etc. trip\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] I used to really like this place but it seems the quality has dropped off. I picked up a to go order today and it reminded me why I had not eaten their food in almost a year.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] Great Mexican food!  I love there chips and Salsa and Bean and Cheese Burrito enchilada style.  One of my \"go to\" places in Mesa! Very reasonable prices!\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] Edit/Update:  They have moved/upgraded/expanded!  The food is consistent through the whole day now as well!!    4 stars changed to 5!!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is my favorite mexican food place ever!!  I rated a 4 because its only good in the day time. After about 4pm it seems it been sitting too long, otherwose id probably eat there way too much.  The xaviers special burrito is amazing as well as their salsa.  Id def recommend xaviers to anyone looking for good mexican food.  My only suggestions would be to upgrade appliances, remodel, expand and open on sundays!\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] I'm not kidding and neither is this place, the green chili bean & cheese burrito is amazing! Once we found this place we went twice in one week! Now I live in downtown Phoenix & can't wait to make the trek to Mesa to eat here! Family owned too!\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] Hands down the best Mexican food in the Valley!  The green chili is amazing! The staff and owners are friendly and the atmosphere is great. You will not be disappointed!\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] Love love love Xavier's!\n",
      "We moved to TX almost 4 years ago and boy do we miss Xavier's Casa Reynoso. It's the real deal Mexican food, not TexMex. We go to Xavier's every time we return to visit AZ.\n",
      "The restaurant is small and occasionally so busy you can't find a place to sit but the food is so amazing that I will wait for a seat to open up.\n",
      "Their food is the best in town. They have a bunch of other family members that own restaurants around the Valley and throughout AZ (Globe, Phoenix, Tempe, Chandler) and are all very similar in taste but Xavier's seems to be better than his relatives; though I'd never pass up a meal at any of his other family members restaurants.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] this is true Arizona old school Mexican food!!!! there is a reason this family has 10 plus restaurants across AZ and still in Business!!! the green chili is good and the cheese crisps are the best around!!!! the salsa is mild and has a great taste!!! the burros are made with another local tortilla company and delivered fresh daily!!!! I am there enough that I have seen the delivery truck on a daily basis and always stop at the other locations this family has in Globe, Safford, Miami and anywhere I have traveled.... highly recommended!!!!\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] The service was very polite and friendly.   I was visiting from Spokane and dropped in.  What a surprise !!!! The food was great with wonderful flavor.   Would recommend this place to everyone.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] Love Love Love Casa.  Sonoran Mexican food at it's best!  The tacos are to die for and the beans are well, the beat beans you'll ever try! The tortillas are fresh and you can tell they're homemade. The enchilada sauce is something of its own with delicious flavor and just the right amount of spice. The green chili is amazing and the salsa too. Everything is fresh and made to order and the service is great. Definitely give Casa a try, your stomach will thank you!\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] Casa Reynoso is definitely nothing fancy, but the food is good and consistently so! I've eaten there about a dozen times and each time has been great. The service isn't great, but it is more of a hole-in-the-wall so I don't expect much. The servers aren't overly cheesy and trying to win a tip. They simply take your order, and bring you good food, followed by the check. That's it. It's usually busy, but I've never had to wait to sit down. The complimentary chips and salsa are great too!\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] Great authentic Mexican food!  Have been here a few times and never disappointed.  Don't forget to bring cash instead of using a credit card to help this local business.\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] I'm from Globe-Miami, the capital of Mexican food...so I grew up eating this family's food. So excited to move back to Mesa and have Xaviers in my backyard. I recommend starting your meal with a cheese crisp!\n",
      "Mexican ['Restaurants', 'Mexican'] Pretty awesome Globe, AZ inspired Mexican food. It's not as fancy as a corporate joint but the food there in delicious. And they always have country music on. Which I appreciate! Order the #1 combo. Tamales are great\n"
